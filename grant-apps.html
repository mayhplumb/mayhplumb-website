		<p>The National Science Foundation's <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> is a prestigious, national (US-based) award for students purusing PhDs in STEM fields and the social sciences. As of 2019, student can apply once before entering graduate school (e.g. during their last year of undergraduate) and once in <i>either</i> their first <i>or</i> second year of graduate school.</p>
		<p>Every eligible PhD student should apply! It is highly competitive and therefore (i) very rewarding if you receive it and (ii) good experience for any future grants and fellowships you apply for.  I applied (unsuccessfully) in Fall 2017, as I was putting in my grad school applications. In Fall 2019, I applied a second time and was successful! I've put my application materials here for reference. My research proposal is for a synchronic and diachronic study of word order in Valley Zapotec, and so these materials are particularly relevant for students applying to work in language documentation and description.</p>
