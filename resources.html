    <p>Because I use LaTeX for most of my typsetting, I end up putting together a lot of special styles for doing linguistic-y things. These are a few that I thought others would find useful.  Feel free to use these files in any way without attribution.</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>A BibLaTeX/Biber style designed specially for CVs! This has the year in a separate left hand column, with the references ordered in reverse chronilogical order (newest publication first). [<a href="files/latex/cv-year-left-mwe.tex">TeX</a>]</li>
    	<li>A method (using BibLaTeX/Biber) of creating a Data Sources section, separate from the rest of the references. While normal references are cited in author-year style, the data sources are cited using special codes. [<a href="files/latex/split-data-citations.tex">TeX</a>] [<a href="files/latex/split-data-citations.pdf">pdf</a>] </li>
