tweets — I have been taking these quat & qual research methods courses on coursera — I’m sad that I haven’t gotten a chance to take pure methods/philosophy of research courses before now, but it’s helpful now that I have developed some of my own internal research philosophy to be able to put words & more contexts behind it

iterative knowledge production — epistemological dialogue — descriptive excess


I'm writing this with the particular backdrop of taking courses of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-methods/">Quantitative Methods</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/">Qualitative Methods</a> from the University of Amsterdam (via Coursera).


Research in language documentation &amp; description frequently bounces between quantitative and qualitative methods — one minute you're observing/participating in a cultural event, another minute you're testing a hypothesis in a structured elicitation session, another minute you're conducting a semi-structured interview. In the evening, you're journaling about your experiences and writing up qualitative memos while tagging data in a spreadsheet.

One benefit of this is that it encourages a qualitative approach to quantitative data, and vise versa, as appropriate. EPISTEMOLOGICAL DIALOGUE. You have increased freedom in how you're going to investigate any particular question, and the doorway is open to compare the outcomes of different methods. The instructor of the qualitative methods course, Gerben Moerman, called this "epistemological dialogue" — I like this phrase to describe this experience! It also captures (although accidentally) the dialogue between my own epistemological stance and that of my colleagues, friends, and teachers in Oaxaca.

Moerman also used the phrase "iterative knowledge production" — the constant back-and-forth between gathering data, reflecting on data, and drawing up theories.
