San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya is located in the Tlacolula Valley in Oaxaca, Mexico. Tlacochahuaya is about 18 kilometers east of Oaxaca City, a 40-minute drive from the city’s historical center, and has around 2,300 inhabitants.  Like most towns in the area, there are three parts of Tlacochahuaya’s name. <i>San Jerónimo</i> (Saint Jerome) is the patron saint of the town. <i>Tlacochahuaya</i> is the town’s Nahuatl name, and the official name used by the state.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Nahuatl is the language of the Aztecs, and the Spanish colonizers adopted these names for many towns throughout Mexico, regardless of the indigenous group that lived there. In Nahuatl, <i>Tlacochahuaya</i> means 'wet place', referring to the lake that used to be here."></a> And of course, Tlacochahuaya also has a Zapotec name: <i>Zunni ro'o</i>.  Incidentally, the word <i>Zapotec</i> also comes from Nahuatl. In Tlacochahuaya, they call Zapotec people <i>Bënza</i>, and the language is <i>Dizhsa</i>.

The word <i>Zapotec</i> does not refer to a single language. Zapotec is a language family which contains dozens of individual languages.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="It’s similar in diversity to the Romance language family, which includes French, Spanish, Romanian, Italian, Catalan, Aragonese…"></a> The Zapotec language family has a high level of dialect variation; in the Tlacolula Valley, every town speakers a slightly distinct variety of Zapotec. This forms what linguists call a "dialect chain", where any two towns next to each other will be quite similar, but towns on opposite ends of the chain will speak very differently.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="I’d also like to note that Oaxaca has a high level of linguistic diversity in general. Zapotec is one of many language families in the region, including Mixe, Otomi, Chatino, Mixtec, Zoque, and Chinantec. And each of these families contains several individual languages. There are hundreds of indigenous languages spoken in the state of Oaxaca!"></a>  In this context, the difference between a "language" and a "dialect" is hard to define. Tlacochahuaya Zapotec is certainly its own variety within the Valley, but for example it has many similarities to the Zapotec spoken in San Lucas Quiaviní (near Tlacolula, which is marked in orange on the map above).

Tlacochahuaya Zapotec grammar is something I'll expand upon in other posts (click <a href="/blog/tag/zapotec/">here</a> for all posts about Zapotec), but here are some basic facts:
<ul>
    <li>Zapotec languages have Verb-Subject-Object word order. That means that while in English we say <i>Tomorrow, Juan will harvest corn</i>, in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec you say "Tomorrow, will harvest Juan corn".
        <table class="interlinear">
            <tr class="foreign"><td>zhi</td> <td>i-nda’a</td> <td>Jwany</td> <td>gehll</td></tr>
            <tr><td>tomorrow</td> <td>future-harvest</td> <td>Juan</td> <td>corn</td></tr>
            <tr class="parts-of-speech"><td>adverb</td> <td>verb</td> <td>subject</td> <td>object</td> </tr>
            <tr><td colspan="4">'Tomorrow, Juan will harvest corn'</td></tr>
        </table>
    </li>
    <li>Zapotec languages are tonal. This means that the pitch of a word can change what it means. Please don’t ask me how many tones Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has. (Talk to me next year, maybe.)</li>
    <li>While English uses the passive construction to say things like <i>The money was counted</i> and <i>The plate was cleaned</i>, Zapotec tends to have stand-alone intranstive verbs for these (<i>-gab</i> 'get counted, <i>-ye</i> 'get cleaned').</li>
    <li>Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has six basic vowels: [i e a o u ɨ]. You can listen to these vowels using the phonetic alphabet guide <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ipachart.com/">here</a>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The sixth vowel [ɨ] is most difficult for English speakers to reproduce. To make it, you can start by make the vowel [i] as in <i>beet</i>. Then make the vowel [u] as in <i>boot</i>. Try going back and forth between these two vowels. Notice that in [i] the front of your tongue is raised up, and your lips are spread in a smile, while in [u] the back of your tongue is raised, and your lips are rounded. To make [ɨ], you should stop about half way between [i] and [u] (with the mid section of your tongue raised) and with your lips spread, not rounded."></a></li>
    <li>In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, when it’s raining while the sun is shining (a sun shower), you say that a deer is being born, <i>kayal bzhëny</i>.</li>
</ul>

In Tlacochahuaya, the youngest (fluent) speaker of Zapotec is in his early 40s. Because children are no longer learning the language — and because of the socioeconomic and cultural pressure of Spanish — linguists consider Tlacochahuaya Zapotec to be highly endangered. There are some towns in the Tlacolula Valley where Zapotec is still spoken by children, but this is very rare, partly because of discrimination against indigenous languages in schools. However, activists in Tlacochahuaya have started language workshops for both adults and children, which are generously supported by the local government.
