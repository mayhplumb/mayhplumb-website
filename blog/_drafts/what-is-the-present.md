In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the "tense" of a verb (which I'm actually going to cal the "TAM"<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="It states for 'tense, aspect, and mood'. You can check out the <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense%E2%80%93aspect%E2%80%93mood'>Wikipedia page</a> to learn more."></a>) is indicated by a prefix, for example 'Juan talks', <i><b>r</b>ni Jwan</i> with <i>r-</i> at the beginning, while 'Juan is talking' is <i><b>ka</b>ni Jwan</i>i> with the prefix <i>ka-</i>. In a <a title="Studying Tlacochahuaya Zapotec 'tense'" href="/blog/2019/06/04/tlacochahuaya-zapotec-tam/">previous post</a>, I looked at how verbs are divided into categories based on which prefixes they use for "past" and "future".

Recently in my research, I've been focusing on that <i>r-</i> prefix in <i>rni Jwan</i> 'Juan talks'.  I want to figure out what the <i>r-</i> means, which is a harder question that it might sound!<!--excerpt--> TAM ("tense") marking in the world's languages is often very complex in meaning. For example, the English "present tense" (<i>eats</i>, <i>sits</i>, <i>hugs</i>) usually indicates that an action is a habit/custom. That is, <i>Ellen eats meat</i> means that Ellen is in the habit of eating meat (but she might not be eating meat right now). However, sports announcers also use the "present tense" form to talk about an event that is happening right this instant (<i>She shoots, she scores!</i>). Furthermore, when you’re telling a story, you can use the same "present tense" to make the events seem more immediate and exciting, even though the events you're talking about were in the past (<i>So I ask them to pass the salt, and they say...</i>).  So in English, we use this "present tense" to mean many different things! Likewise, I want to know all the ways that you can use the Tlacochahuaya Zapotec <i>r-</i> prefix.

When other researchers have described Zapotec languages, they usually call the <i>r-</i> prefix a "habitual aspect marker" because it’s prototypical use is to indicate a habitual/customary action. Like the English "present"! However, unlike the English :present" it can also be used to talk about past habitual actions. Depending on context, <i>rni Jwan</i> could just as easily mean 'Juan talks [all the time]' or 'Juan talked [all the time, e.g. when he was a child]'. Now, we can contrast this with the prefix <i>ka-</i>, which indicates that an action is in progress. Like with <i>r-</i>, <i>ka-</i> can talk about the present or the past, so <i>kani Jwan</i> can mean either 'Juan is talking' or 'Juan was talking'.

So far, this seems pretty straight forward. Well, it is, until you ask someone how to say 'the baby is sleeping', and they say <i>ra’asy bdo</i>.
<table class="interlinear">
	<tr class="foreign"><td>r-a'asy</td> <td>bdo</td></tr>
	<tr><td>R-sleep</td> <td>baby</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="4">'The baby is sleeping.'</td></tr>
</table>

It turns out that with the verb 'sleep', you usually don’t use the prefix <i>ka-</i>. You just use <i>r-</i> instead. There are a couple of other verbs like this, including 'snore' and 'be hungry'.
<table class="interlinear">
	<tr class="foreign"><td>r-ubikia</td> <td>bëny</td></tr>
	<tr><td>R-snore</td> <td>person</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="4">'The person is snoring.'</td></tr>
</table>

<table class="interlinear">
	<tr class="foreign"><td>r-ndyeny</td> <td>be'ekw</td></tr>
	<tr><td>R-be.hungry</td> <td>dog</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="4">'The dog is hungry.'</td></tr>
</table>

So a question I have right now is: which verbs exactly act like this? Is a fixed set of random verbs? Or is a category based on the type of action? One hypothesis I’m exploring right now is that all the verbs I've found so far that use <i>r-</i> where I expect <i>ka-</i> are relatively "unintentional" actions. (For example, the man in the example above isn’t trying to snore.) But I need to find more examples to really figure it out!
