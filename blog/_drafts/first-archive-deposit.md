Welcome to the blog! I’m using my inaugural post to mark a momentous occasion. It is with great pride that I announce <i>&#42;drumroll&#42;</i> my very first archive deposit!  I'll go into more detail below, but if you want to skip ahead, you can check out my archive collection <a target="_blank" title="Zapotec Collection of May Helena Plumb" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:257460">here</a>.

Last summer (2018), I spent five weeks in San Jéronimo Tlacochahuaya (Oaxaca, Mexico) learning about the Zapotec language they speak there.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Tlacochahuaya Zapotec is also spoken in in diaspora communities in the United States.  It's a beautiful language. If you don't want to sift through my archive deposit, you can check out the <a target='_blank' title='Explore the Tlacochahuaya Zapotec Talking Dictionary' href='http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/tlacochahuaya/'>Tlacochahuaya Zapotec Talking Dictionary</a>, or watch clips from <a target='_blank' title='Dizhsa Nabani' href='https://doculabs.haverford.edu/dizhsanabani/watch/'>Watch Dizhsa Nabani</a>, a documentary about language and daily life in Tlacochahuaya."></a> I came home with lots of recordings, data which will be the foundation of my future research on Tlacochahuaya Zapotec grammar.<!--exerpt-->  These recordings aren't just useful to me, though, they're important for anyone who wants to learn about Zapotec (or anyone who wants to evaluate my claims).  So I put them in an <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Broadly speaking, an archive is a collection of objects that have been organized, cataloged, and otherwise prepared for long-term preservation. Archives are similar to museums, except that while museum curation focuses on the display of objects, archiving focuses on the permanent preservation of the objects.  If you want to learn more about archives, I recommend <a target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/QNN2LFe_iD8'>this video from the Tate</a>">archive</a>, so that anyone can access to them. I chose the <a target="_blank" title="AILLA homepage" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/">Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America</a> (AILLA), which is hosted at the University of Texas.  All of my recordings are publicly available. <a target="_blank" title="Zapotec Collection of May Helena Plumb" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:257460">You could go listen to them!</a> (All you need to do is <a target="_blank" title="AILLA registration page" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/user/register">create a free AILLA account</a>.)

I'll continue to add to my archive collection as my research progresses, but for now, there are 29 resources (63 total files) about Tlacochahuaya Zapotec.  Some of these resources are short texts in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, such as a session where Antonio García Cruz talked to me about <a target="_blank" title="About donkeys (AntonioGC)" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262614">how smart donkeys are</a>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Donkeys are very good at remembering routes and finding their way home, and they can navigate down craggy slopes very gently while carrying a heavy load."></a> Other resources focus on particular words and phrases, such as my conversations with Moisés García Guzmán about <a target="_blank" title="Funerals in SJT (MoisesGG)" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262635">ritual speech at Tlacochahuaya funerals</a>. Right now, most of the resources contain audio recordings in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec and Spanish,<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="My conversations with Moisés are mostly in English, so if you don't speak Spanish those are good resources to check out."></a> but in the future, I'll add transcriptions and translations of the Zapotec audio.


This archive deposit has been a full year in the making,<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Yeah, it took a long time. I’ll write about why in a future post, probably."></a> and it’s an exciting step in my research process. As I said above, putting my data in an archive means that other people can access it, which is an important part of responsible scholarship.  But why an archive and not just a personal website? Because AILLA will store my data longterm, making sure the recordings are safeguarded against <a target="_blank" class="jargon" title="Wikipedia page for data degradation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">data decay</a> and <a target="_blank" class="jargon" title="Wikipedia page for digital obsolescence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence">digital obscelence</a>. This means that in the future, when Tlacochahuaya Zapotec changes (<a target="_blank" title="Linguistics Society of America page on language change" href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/english-changing">as all languages do</a>) or if it <a target="_blank" title="Article on language endangerment from the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.21">ceases to be spoken</a>, we will still have a record of how it was spoken in 2018. Maintaining data is a lot of work, so to close, I'd like to thank the lovely folks at AILLA for their help setting up my collection. Give your archivist a (consensual) hug today!
