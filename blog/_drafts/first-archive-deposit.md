Welcome to the blog! I’m using my inaugural post to mark a momentous occasion. It is with great pride that I announce <i>&#42;drumroll&#42;</i> <a target="_blank" title="Zapotec Collection of May Helena Plumb" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:257460">my very first archive deposit</a>! This has been a full year in the making,<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Yeah, it took a long time. I’ll write about why in a future post, probably."></a> and it’s an exciting step in my research progress.  Here I’m going to answer three questions: (1) What even <i>is</i> an archive? (2) What exactly is in my archive deposit? And (3) why are archives important?

Broadly speaking, an <span class="jargon">archive</span> is a collection of objects that have been organized, cataloged, and otherwise prepared for long-term preservation.<!--exerpt--> Archives are similar to museums, except that while museum curation focuses on the <i>display</i> of objects, archiving focuses on the <i>permanent preservation</i> of the objects.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="I really hope no archivists or museum directors come after me over this definition."></a>  Archives (like museums) usually collect items related to a particular topic. The <a target="_blank" title="National Archives website" href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives</a>, for example, contain documents related to the United States federal government, which includes everything from <a target="_blank" title="Constitution of the United States, ID 1667751" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1667751">the Constitution of the United States</a> to various photos of <a target="_blank" title="Obama hugging Gabby Giffords, ID 118817949" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118817949">Barack</a> <a target="_blank" title="Obama hugging Susie Pierce, ID 24477925" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24477925">Obama</a> <a target="_blank" title="Obama hugging Julie Lewis, ID 24477939" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24477939">hugging</a> <a target="_blank" title="Obama hugging Joe Biden, ID 118818037" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118818037">people</a>.  Archives also record information about the artefacts, such as when they were created or who was involved. We call this information <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="For example, the picture of <a target='_blank' href='https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118818037'>Barack Obama hugging Joe Biden</a> is a piece of data about US history.  The location (Wilmington, Delaware), date (June 6, 2015), and photographer (Pete Souza) are data <i>about</i> that data. <i>Meta</i>data.">metadata</a>. Archives organize their holdings to collections and label items with permanent, unique identifiers. This means that you can very precisely specific which object your referencing (e.g. in a citation).  

Now, my data isn’t in the National Archives, because it doesn't relate to the US government. My research focuses on Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, a language spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico,<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Specifically, Tlacochahuaya Zapotec is spoken in San Jéronimo Tlacochahuaya (a town about 18km outside of Oaxaca City), as well as in diaspora communities in the United States.  It's a beautiful language. If you don't want to sift through my archive deposit, you can check out the <a target='_blank' href='http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/tlacochahuaya/'>Tlacochahuaya Zapotec Talking Dictionary</a>."></a> so I created <a target="_blank" title="Zapotec Collection of May Helena Plumb" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:257460">a collection</a> in the <a target="_blank" title="AILLA homepage" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/">Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA)</a>.  My recent archive deposit is a portion of the data I collected last summer (in 2018); as my research progreses, I'll add additional recordings to the collection.  Among the resources I deposited are short texts in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, such as a session where Antonio García Cruz talked to me about <a target="_blank" title="About donkeys (AntonioGC)" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262614">how smart donkeys are</a>. Other resources focus on individual words and phrases, such as my conversations with Moisés García Guzmán about <a target="_blank" title="Funerals in SJT (MoisesGG)" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262635">ritual speech at Tlacochahuaya funerals</a>. In total, I deposited 63 files, divided into 29 resources. All of these materials are publicly available, so anyone can go listen to them. You could go listen to them! (All you need to do is <a target="_blank" title="AILLA registration page" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/user/register">create a free AILLA account</a>.)

I’ve been looking forward to making my first archive deposit for a long time. I wrote about archiving in my grad school applications, and I’ve been geeking out about metadata for years. Why is it so important to me? On my computer, the data is useful only to me. In an archive, the data is available to anyone in the world, <i>forever</i>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Well, in theory, anyway."></a> This means that other linguists can go listen to my recordings to verify my claims about the language.  It also means that in the future, when Tlacochahuaya Zapotec changes (<a target="_blank" title="Linguistics Society of America page on language change" href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/english-changing">as all languages do</a>) or if it <a target="_blank" title="Article on language endangerment from the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.21">ceases to be spoken</a>, we will still have a record of how it was spoken in 2018. In addition to housing my data on a public website, AILLA will make sure that my data is safeguarded against damage and <a target="_blank" class="jargon" title="Wikipedia page for digital obsolescence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence">digital obscelence</a>. That's a lot of work, so to close, I'd like to thank the lovely folks at AILLA for their help setting up my collection. Give your archivist a (consensual) hug today!
