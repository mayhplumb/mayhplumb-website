I’m using my inaugural blog post to mark a momentous occasion. It is with great pride that I announce <i>&#42;drumroll&#42;</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:257460">my very first archive deposit</a>! Are you excited? Well, I am. This has been a full year in the making,<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="I’ll write about why in a future post, probably."></a> and it’s an important part of my research progress.  Here I’m going to answer three questions: (1) What even <i>is</i> an archive? (2) What exactly is in my archive deposit? And (3) why are archives important?

Broadly speaking, an <span class="jargon">archive</span> is a collection of objects that have been organized, cataloged, and otherwise prepared for long-term preservation.<!--exerpt--> Archives are similar to museums, except that museum curation focuses on the <i>display</i> of objects, while archiving focuses on the <i>permanent preservation</i> of the objects.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="I really hope no archivists or museum directors come after me over this definition."></a>  A concrete example is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives</a>, which contain the records of the United States federal government, including everything from <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1667751">the Constitution of the United States</a> to various pictures of <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118817949">Barack</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24477925">Obama</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24477939">hugging</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118818037">people</a>.  If you look at any of the archive records in those links, you’ll notice that they contain information about the objects, such as the date of creation and the authors.  We call this information <span class="jargon">metadata</span>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="For example, the picture of <a target='_blank' href='https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118818037'>Barack Obama hugging Joe Biden</a> is a piece of data about US history.  The location (Wilmington, Delaware), date (June 6, 2015), and photographer (Pete Souza) are data <i>about</i> that data. <i>Meta</i>data."></a> The objects in the National Archives are also organized into collections and series and labeled with permanent, unique identifiers. This means that you can very precisely specific which object your referencing (e.g. in a citation).  

Now, my data isn’t in the National Archives, because it doesn't relate to the US government. My research focuses on Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, a language spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico,<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Specifically, Tlacochahuaya Zapotec is spoken in San Jéronimo Tlacochahuaya (a town about 18km outside of Oaxaca City), as well as in diaspora communities in the United States.  It's a beautiful language. If you don't want to sift through my archive deposit, you can check out the <a target='_blank' href='http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/tlacochahuaya/'>Tlacochahuaya Zapotec Talking Dictionary</a>."></a> so I created <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:257460">a collection</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/">Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA)</a>.  My recent archive deposit is a portion of the data I collected last summer (in 2018) during my first independent field trip to Oaxaca.  Some of the resources are short texts in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, such as a session where Antonio García Cruz talked to me about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262614">how smart donkeys are</a>. Other resources focus on individual words and phrases, such as my conversations with Moisés García Guzmán about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262635">ritual speech at Tlacochahuaya funerals</a>. In total, I deposited 63 files, divided into 29 resources. All of these materials are publicly available, so anyone can go listen to them. You could go listen to them! (All you need to do is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/user/register">create a free AILLA account</a>.)

I’ve been looking forward to making my first archive deposit for a long time. I wrote about archiving in my grad school applications, and I’ve been geeking out about metadata for years. Why is it so important to me? On my computer, the data is useful only to me. In an archive, the data is available to anyone in the world, <i>forever</i>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Well, in theory, anyway."></a> This means that other linguists can go listen to my recordings to verify my claims about the language.  It also means that in the future, when Tlacochahuaya Zapotec changes (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/english-changing">as all languages do</a>) or if it <a target="_blank" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.21">ceases to be spoken</a>, we will still have a record of how it was spoken in 2018. In addition to housing my data on a public website, AILLA will make sure that my data is safeguarded against damage and <a target="_blank" class="jargon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence">digital obscelence</a>. That's a lot of work, so to close, I'd like to thank the lovely folks at AILLA for their help setting up my collection. Give your archivist a (consensual) hug today!
