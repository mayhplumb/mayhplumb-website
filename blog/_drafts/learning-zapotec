This semester, I've started taking Zapotec lessons from my colleague and friend Moisés García Guzmán! I'd like to share some of my experiences and strategies.

Is this new?

I've "worked with" Zapotec languages since 2013, so you might well ask "Why are you taking lessons now?" Language documentation and description is very different from language learning. During my graduate research in Tlacochahuaya, I have primarily focused on understanding parts of the grammar, asking questions like "What types of verbs are able to take this prefix?" and "How does this prefix change a sentences meaning?". I have learned a lot about Tlacochahuaya Zapotec (and what the prefixes mean!) but I don't know much about speaking it. So this year, I'm putting some time into memorizing vocabulary and practicing short conversations — the sorts of things you do in an introductory language class. (Moisés is trained as a language teacher, which means he's well prepared to help me with this!)

Why haven't I done this sooner? Well, I wish I had. But I got very sucked up into "producing research", and I felt like I didn't have time for the technically non-essential task of language learning. 

To improve my Spanish, I sometimes talk to Spanish-speaking friends, or read Spanish books, or use apps like DuoLingo. But no one around me speaks Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, and the DuoLingo owl can't help me here! I didn't want to just review flash cards all day, so I've had to get creative with how I study. Here's an example: On Monday, Moisés taught me how to talk about the weather. I decided to practice my new vocabulary by keeping a weather log in the form of a Twitter thread. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An dzhi lo rsily beny nis gie ndas nez Austin // Today in the morning it was drizzling in Austin <a href="https://t.co/6SF2G7GIQC">pic.twitter.com/6SF2G7GIQC</a></p>&mdash; May Helena Plumb (@mayhplumb) <a href="https://twitter.com/mayhplumb/status/1351997177975992322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This gave me an opportunity to try and write new sentences in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, and I got to share my learning with my friends on Twitter! Even though most of my Twitter audience can't understand the Zapotec, it still felt more satisfying than just writing the sentences down in a notebook. To make it more fun, I including images to highlight a key vocabulary word, like <i>nis gie<i> 'rain'. Every bit of practice, including making a vocabulary card, strengthens my memory of that word!
