One of the first things you learn when studying a language are the <span class="jargon">pronouns</span> — the <i>it</i>'s and <i>they</i>'s and <i>we</i>'s of a language. We use pronouns like variables, so that we refer to different people and objects without using their full names.  <i>Some</i> of the pronouns of English are shown below. For the purpose of this table, I chosen the pronouns that I use most frequently/naturally.

<table class="center">
    <caption>(Some of the) English pronouns</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th></th> <th>singular</th> <th>plural</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td>1st person</td>						<td class="foreign">I</td>		<td class="foreign">we</td> 				</tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person</td>						<td class="foreign">you</td>	<td class="foreign">you/y'all</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, feminine</td>				<td class="foreign">she</td>	<td class="foreign">they</td> 				</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, masculine</td>				<td class="foreign">he</td>		<td class="foreign">they</td> 				</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, neutral/agender</td>		<td class="foreign">they</td>	<td class="foreign">they</td>				</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, inanimate/nonhuman</td>	<td class="foreign">it</td>		<td class="foreign">it</td> 				</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

There are many other pronouns that can go on this list. Some dialects of English have <i>youse</i> as a 2nd person plural, for example. Some people use agender pronouns like <i>zie</i>.  It's also true that some of these labels are oversimplified.  The so-called "royal <i>we</i>" is singular, not plural, for example. And while I've called <i>it</i> the "3rd person, inanimate/nonhuman" form, we commonly give gendered animate pronouns to inanimate objects, like when we call boats<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Or if you're Jonathan Van Ness, anything!"></a> <i>she</i>.

The pronoun system I've given for English is just one way of dividing up individuals into groups. But different languages have different sets of pronouns! Many languages have a distinction between formal and informal 2nd person pronouns, like Spanish <i>Usted</i> vs. <i>tú</i>.  So how does this play out in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec? Here's the pronouns as I currently understand them:

<table class="center">

    <thead>
        <tr> <th></th> <th>singular</th> <th>plural</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td>1st person</td>				<td class="foreign">nare</td>	<td class="foreign">donn</td> 		</tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person, informal</td>		<td class="foreign">liu</td>	<td class="foreign"> </td> 			</tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person, formal</td>		<td class="foreign">gibiu</td>	<td class="foreign"> </td> 			</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, informal</td>		<td class="foreign">lany</td>	<td class="foreign">ladehny</td> 	</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, formal</td>		<td class="foreign">lab</td>	<td class="foreign">ladep</td> 		</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, masculine?</td>	<td class="foreign">lazh:</td>	<td class="foreign">ladezh:</td>	</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, animal</td>		<td class="foreign"> </td>		<td class="foreign">ladem</td> 		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

There are a few patterns we can notice here.  First, the third person plural pronouns all include &lt;de&gt;. In fact, <i>de</i> on it's own is just a plural marker! So for example, <i>geht<i> means 'tortilla' and <i>de geht</i> means 'tortillas'.

We can also see that the third person pronouns begin with &lt;la&gt; Well, there's something I haven't told you. This is just <i>one</i> set of Zapotec pronouns. We call these the "independent pronouns", because they can appear alone. There's another set — the "bound pronouns" — which can appear attached to verbs, never on their own.  For example, the 3rd person informal singular <u>bound pronoun</u> is <i>=ni</i>, while the <u>independent pronoun</u> is <i>lany</i>.  Each of the third person independent pronouns shares the same base, &lt;la&gt;.

For comparison, let's look at pronouns from San Lucas Quiaviní, another Zapotec-speaking town, just a few kilometers away from Tlacochahuaya.  You'll notice they look pretty different!

    <tbody>
        <tr> <td>1st person</td>						<td class="foreign">na</td>		<td class="foreign">dannonn</td> 	</tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person, informal</td>				<td class="foreign">liu</td>	<td class="foreign">lad</td> 		</tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person, formal</td>				<td class="foreign">yu</td>		<td class="foreign">yuad</td> 		</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, informal, nearby</td>		<td class="foreign">lang</td>	<td class="foreign">larëng</td> 	</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, informal, far away</td>	<td class="foreign">lai</td>	<td class="foreign">lariny</td> 	</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, respectful</td>			<td class="foreign">lazh:</td>	<td class="foreign">larazh:</td> 	</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, reverant</td>				<td class="foreign">lainy</td>	<td class="foreign">lariny</td> 	</tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, animal</td>				<td class="foreign">lamm</td>	<td class="foreign">larëmm</td> 	</tr>
    </tbody>

The San Lucas Quiaviní pronouns still have the &lt;la&gt; that we saw in Tlacochahuaya. One key difference thought is that where Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has &lt;de&gt;, San Lucas Quiaviní has &lt;r&gt; or &lt;rë&gt;. Also, San Lucas Quiaviní has more pronouns! In particular they distinguish between "nearby" and "faraway" in the 3rd person informal. You might also notice that the San Lucas Quiaviní "respectful" pronoun, <i>lazh:</i>, looks a lot like the Tlacochahuaya "masculine" pronoun, <i>lazh:</i>.  The Tlacochahuaya version has been described to me as being only for men, but it could be it's used more generally in practice — that's something I'll need to find out! Also, just like we ofen use human pronouns for boats, it's likely that people can use Tlacochahuaya Zapotec pronouns outside of their "typical" categories.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content='For example, in San Lucas Quiaviní, the "nearby" and "far away" categories may refer to either physical or psychological distance.'></a> That's something I'm on the look out for when I'm translating Zapotec stories.
