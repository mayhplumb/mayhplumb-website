</p> <p><p>I’m home in Austin now. My 2019 fieldwork is complete.</p>

<p>Fieldwork is complicated for me, as I imagine it is for many researchers. It is simultaneously the best part of my job and the most stressful. Research in the field is hard, and by the end I’m mentally exhausted. Traveling is hard for me, and usually after a month I’m emotionally exhausted. But overall, spending time in Oaxaca is one of the greatest blessings of my life (I wouldn’t do it if it didn’t make me happy). This post is a collection of things I love about Oaxaca, drafted slowly over the past five weeks.</p>

<p>In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the “tense” of a verb (which I’m actually going to call the “TAM”<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="It stands for 'tense, aspect, and mood'. You can check out the &lt;a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense%E2%80%93aspect%E2%80%93mood'&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; to learn more, or see &lt;a target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/VM8GlP6avF4'&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion of the difference between tense and aspect"></a>) is indicated by a prefix, for example ‘Juan talks’ is <i><b>r</b>ni Jwan</i> with <i>r-</i> at the beginning, while ‘Juan is talking’ is <i><b>ka</b>ni Jwan</i> with the prefix <i>ka-</i>. In a <a title="Studying Tlacochahuaya Zapotec 'tense'" href="/blog/2019/06/04/tlacochahuaya-zapotec-tam/">previous post</a>, I looked at how verbs are divided into categories based on which TAM prefixes they use for “past” and “future”.</p>

<p>Recently in my research, I’ve been focusing on that <i>r-</i> prefix in <i>rni Jwan</i> ‘Juan talks’.  I want to figure out what the <i>r-</i> means, which is a harder question that it might sound!</p>

</p> <p><p>This summer is my fifth research trip to Oaxaca, and over the years I’ve developed a few ways to remedy stress and homesickness.  To be clear, I love Oaxaca. It is a pleasure and a privilege to come here every year. But fieldwork is <i>hard</i>, and because the essence of my research is so tied up in my daily life, I need to be really conscious about taking breaks and de-stressing.</p>

<p>Some of my self-care is in the little things that I pack. I always bring some nail polish, because it encourages me to take little moments for myself.</p>

<p>One of the first things you learn when studying a language are the <span class="jargon">pronouns</span> — the <i>it</i>’s and <i>they</i>’s and <i>we</i>’s of a language. We use pronouns like variables, so that we can refer to different people and objects without using their full names.  <i>Some</i> of the pronouns of English are shown below. For the purpose of this table, I chosen the pronouns that I use most frequently/naturally.</p>

<table class="center">
    <caption>(Some of the) English pronouns</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th></th> <th>singular</th> <th>plural</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td>1st person</td>                        <td class="foreign">I</td>        <td class="foreign">we</td>                 </tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person</td>                        <td class="foreign">you</td>    <td class="foreign">you/y'all</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, feminine</td>                <td class="foreign">she</td>    <td class="foreign">they</td>                 </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, masculine</td>                <td class="foreign">he</td>        <td class="foreign">they</td>                 </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, neutral/agender</td>        <td class="foreign">they</td>    <td class="foreign">they</td>                </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, inanimate/nonhuman</td>    <td class="foreign">it</td>        <td class="foreign">it</td>                 </tr>

<p>The current focus of my research is “tense” in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec. That’s what I’ll be writing my <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="A paper you write to prove you’re ready to write a doctoral dissertation. In my department, it’s about the same length and rigor as a Master’s thesis.">Qualifying Paper</a> about next fall, and it’s the primary focus of my <a title="Posts about my 2019 fieldwork" href="/blog/tag/fieldwork2019/">fieldwork this summer</a>.</p>

<p>I put “tense” in quotes because what we colloquially call “tense”, linguists break down into three smaller categories: <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The chronology of events. When something happened relative to a certain point in time. Did it happen yesterday? Three years ago? Is it going to happen tomorrow?">tense</a>, <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Roughly, the state of the events progress — is it completed? in progress? ongoing? happening regularly? Some people call this the &quot;shape&quot; of the event.">aspect</a>, and <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="How real the event is. Is it something that definitely happened? Or something that was supposed to happen but didn't? Something that might happen? Something that will definitely happen tomorrow?">mood</a> (abbreviated together as TAM; click the words to get pop-up definitions).  These three categories are often very intertwined — it’s almost impossible to talk about one without the other two.  So what I’m actually researching right now is <i>TAM</i> in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec.</p>
