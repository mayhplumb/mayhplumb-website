    <p><p>Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about research methods. The next step of my PhD program is writing a dissertation proposal — so in a nut shell, I need to decide what questions I’m asking and what methods I’ll use to answer them.</p>

<p>In general, people usually talk about two data sources for language description: elicitation and texts. <span class="jargon">Elicitation</span> includes asking for translations of words or sentences — “How do you say X in your language?”. Sometimes the researcher will construct a sentence and ask if it’s grammatical, and sometimes people elicit words and sentences using pictures rather than a verbal prompt, but elicitation always means you’re directly asking for a piece of linguistic information. When we say <span class="jargon">text</span>, on the other hand, we mean a more natural type of speech — for example someone telling a story, or explaining how to do a particular task. A text could be written or spoken; regardless, linguists then search the text for examples of a particular phenomenon and analyze it’s use.</p>

    <p><p>I’m home in Austin now. My 2019 fieldwork is complete.</p>

<p>Fieldwork is complicated for me, as I imagine it is for many researchers. It is simultaneously the best part of my job and the most stressful. Research in the field is hard, and by the end I’m mentally exhausted. Traveling is hard for me, and usually after a month I’m emotionally exhausted. But overall, spending time in Oaxaca is one of the greatest blessings of my life (I wouldn’t do it if it didn’t make me happy). This post is a collection of things I love about Oaxaca, drafted slowly over the past five weeks.</p>

				Hello! Like many things I post on this blog, this research is in very early stages. This means that I may have simplified some more complicated details. It also means I might just be wrong! So please take this information as an early hypothesis, not a solid fact. If you'd like to find out my up-to-date opinions on the topic, feel free to email me.

<p>In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the “tense” of a verb (which I’m actually going to call the “TAM”<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="It stands for 'tense, aspect, and mood'. You can check out the &lt;a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense%E2%80%93aspect%E2%80%93mood'&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; to learn more, or see &lt;a target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/VM8GlP6avF4'&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion of the difference between tense and aspect"></a>) is indicated by a prefix, for example ‘Juan talks’ is <i><b>r</b>ni Jwan</i> with <i>r-</i> at the beginning, while ‘Juan is talking’ is <i><b>ka</b>ni Jwan</i> with the prefix <i>ka-</i>. In a <a title="Studying Tlacochahuaya Zapotec 'tense'" href="/blog/2019/06/04/tlacochahuaya-zapotec-tam/">previous post</a>, I looked at how verbs are divided into categories based on which TAM prefixes they use for “past” and “future”.</p>

<p>Recently in my research, I’ve been focusing on that <i>r-</i> prefix in <i>rni Jwan</i> ‘Juan talks’.  I want to figure out what the <i>r-</i> means, which is a harder question that it might sound!</p>

    <p><p>San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya is located in the Tlacolula Valley in Oaxaca, Mexico. Tlacochahuaya is about 18 kilometers east of Oaxaca City, a 40-minute drive from the city’s historical center, and has around 2,300 inhabitants.  Like most towns in the area, there are three parts of Tlacochahuaya’s name. <i>San Jerónimo</i> (Saint Jerome) is the patron saint of the town. <i>Tlacochahuaya</i> is the town’s Nahuatl name, and the official name used by the state.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Nahuatl is the language of the Aztecs, and the Spanish colonizers adopted these names for many towns throughout Mexico, regardless of the indigenous group that lived there. In Nahuatl, &lt;i&gt;Tlacochahuaya&lt;/i&gt; means 'wet place', referring to the lake that used to be here."></a> And of course, Tlacochahuaya also has a Zapotec name: <i>Zunni ro’o</i>.  Incidentally, the word <i>Zapotec</i> also comes from Nahuatl. In Tlacochahuaya, they call Zapotec people <i>Bënza</i>, and the language is <i>Dizhsa</i>.</p>
