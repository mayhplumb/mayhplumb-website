The short answer is, this is a wug:

<!--excerpt-->

The wug was invented by linguist Jean Berko Gleason<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="I took a selfie with her once. <img width='200px' src='/blog/img/what-is-a-wug/selfie-with-jean.jpg'/>"></a> as part of a language acquisition experiment. Gleason wanted to find out when children learned to make English plurals.  So she drew small creatures with made-up names, like the wug, and set up a task where children were prompted to say plural forms of the words. The prompt looked like this:

<img class="mx-auto d-block"  height="500px" alt="A drawing of a bird is followed by the text 'This is a wug'. Two more birds are followed by the text 'Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two _'" title="If you have a high-quality image of one of the other animals, let me know." src="/blog/img/what-is-a-wug/this-is-a-wug-test.png">

The English plural of <i>wug</i> would be pronounced with a [z] sound on the end, [wʌgz].  If children produce this form, it means they've learned a general rule about creating English plurals, rather than simply memorizing the singular and plural of each noun. Gleason found that most preschoolers know how to make this plural (76%), and that almost all children aquire it by around age six (97% of first-graders).  She published these results in an 1958 article "The Child's Learning of English Morphology".<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The offical article is <a target='_blank' title='official page at Taylor &amp; Francis' href='https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1958.11659661'>here</a>.  There's currently a free PDF <a target='_blank' title='PDF from Western University' href='https://anthropology.uwo.ca/faculty/creider/027/wugs.pdf'>here</a>."></a>  

Wugs are just so cute, they became the unoffical mascot of linguistics.  You'll find them on mugs and t-shirts, and I embroidered one in the center of my animal-themed English vowel chart (for the <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" title="International Phonetic Alphabet" data-content="The IPA is a standardized system where every speech sound is assigned a unique symbol. <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet'>Wikipedia</a> is a good starting place to learn more.">IPA</a> vowel [ʌ]).
