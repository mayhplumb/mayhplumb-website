What happens if a make some more posts, but in the future? I want them to look nice.<!--exerpt-->
Here is an example of a <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="<b>Jargon words</b> are technical terms used only within a certain field. I define them in these boxes so that any readers can understand my writing.">jargon word</a>. And I'm going to add a footnote.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Look, a footnote!"></a> And some text after, so I can see some more.


Here's some more text in a new paragraph.
