In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the "tense" of a verb (which I'm actually going to call the "TAM"<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="It states for 'tense, aspect, and mood'. You can check out the <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense%E2%80%93aspect%E2%80%93mood'>Wikipedia page</a> to learn more, or see <a target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/VM8GlP6avF4'>this video</a> for a discussion of the difference between tense and aspect"></a>) is indicated by a prefix, for example 'Juan talks' is <i><b>r</b>ni Jwan</i> with <i>r-</i> at the beginning, while 'Juan is talking' is <i><b>ka</b>ni Jwan</i> with the prefix <i>ka-</i>. In a <a title="Studying Tlacochahuaya Zapotec 'tense'" href="/blog/2019/06/04/tlacochahuaya-zapotec-tam/">previous post</a>, I looked at how verbs are divided into categories based on which TAM prefixes they use for "past" and "future".

Recently in my research, I've been focusing on that <i>r-</i> prefix in <i>rni Jwan</i> 'Juan talks'.  I want to figure out what the <i>r-</i> means, which is a harder question that it might sound!<!--excerpt--> TAM ("tense") in the world's languages is often very complex in meaning. For example, the English "present tense" (<i>eats</i>, <i>sits</i>, <i>hugs</i>) usually indicates that an action is a habit/custom. That is, <i>Ellen eats meat</i> means that Ellen is in the habit of eating meat (but she might not be eating meat right now). However, sports announcers also use the "present tense" form to talk about an event that is happening right this instant (<i>She shoots, she scores!</i>). Furthermore, you can use the same "present tense" to make a story seem more immediate and exciting, even if the events you're talking about happened in the past (<i>So I ask them to pass the salt, and they say...</i>).  So in English, we use this "present tense" to mean many different things! Likewise, I want to know all the ways that you can use the Tlacochahuaya Zapotec <i>r-</i> prefix.

When other researchers have described Zapotec languages, they usually call the <i>r-</i> prefix "habitual" because it’s prototypical use is to indicate a habitual/customary action. Like the English present! However, unlike the English present, the Zapotec habitual can also be used to talk about <i>past</i> habitual actions (like English <i>used to</i>). Depending on context, <i>rni Jwan</i> could just as easily mean 'Juan talks [all the time]' or 'Juan used to talk [all the time, e.g. when he was a child]'. The Zapotec habitual <i>r-</i> contrasts with the prefix <i>ka-</i>, which indicates that an action is in progress (we call it "progressive"). Like with <i>r-</i>, <i>ka-</i> can talk about the present or the past, so <i>kani Jwan</i> can mean either 'Juan is talking' or 'Juan was talking'.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="For those following along at home: 'Juan talks' in English is desribed as present tense, habitual aspect. 'Juan is talking' is described as present tense, progressive aspect."></a>

So far, this seems pretty straight forward. Well, it is, until you ask someone how to say 'the baby is sleeping', and they say <i>ra’asy bdo</i>.
<table class="interlinear">
	<tr class="foreign"><td>r-a'asy</td> <td>bdo</td></tr>
	<tr><td>R-sleep<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="This is called an <span class='jargon'>interlinear gloss</span>. The idea is to label each part of each word with it's meaning. But since I don't really know what <i>r-</i> means yet, I'm just labelling it 'R'!"></a></td> <td>baby</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="4">'The baby is sleeping.'</td></tr>
</table>

It turns out that with the verb 'sleep', you usually don’t use the prefix <i>ka-</i>. You just use <i>r-</i> instead. There are a couple of other verbs like this, including 'snore' and 'be hungry'.
<table class="interlinear">
	<tr class="foreign"><td>r-ubikia</td> <td>bëny</td></tr>
	<tr><td>R-snore</td> <td>person</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="4">'The person is snoring.'</td></tr>
</table>

<table class="interlinear">
	<tr class="foreign"><td>r-ndyeny</td> <td>be'ekw</td></tr>
	<tr><td>R-be.hungry</td> <td>dog</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="4">'The dog is hungry.'</td></tr>
</table>

So a question I have right now is: which verbs exactly act like this? Is a fixed set of random verbs? Or is a category based on the type of action? I have a hypothesis I'm working with right now, but it's too soon in the game to even post about it here!
