The current focus of my research is "tense" in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec. That’s what I’ll be writing my <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="A paper you write to prove you’re ready to write a doctoral dissertation. In my department, it’s about the same length and rigor as a Master’s thesis.">Qualifying Paper</a> about next fall, and it’s the primary focus of my <a title="Posts about my 2019 fieldwork" href="/blog/tag/fieldwork2019/">fieldwork this summer</a>.

I put "tense" in quotes because what we colloquially call "tense", linguists break down into three smaller categories: <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The chronology of events. When something happened relative to a certain point in time. Did it happen yesterday? Three years ago? Is it going to happen tomorrow?">tense</a>, <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content='Roughly, the state of the events progress — is it completed? in progress? ongoing? happening regularly? Some people call this the "shape" of the event.'>aspect</a>, and <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="How real the event is. Is it something that definitely happened? Or something that was supposed to happen but didn't? Something that might happen? Something that will definitely happen tomorrow?">mood</a> (abbreviated together as TAM; click the words to get pop-up definitions).  These three categories are often very intertwined — it's almost impossible to talk about one without the other two.  So what I'm actually researching right now is <i>TAM</i> in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec.<!--excerpt--><a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Most TAM markers in Zapotec languages are described as being primarily aspectual (having to do with aspect). But they also have implications about tense and mood."></a>

In English, TAM can be marked with a suffix on the verb, as in <i>I dance</i> vs. <i>I dance<b>d</b></i>, where <i>-d</i> marks the past tense. We also use auxiliary verbs, like the <i>will</i> in <i>I <b>will</b> dance</i>. In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, TAM is primarily indicated by a prefix on the verb, instead of a suffix.  For example, 'Juan talks' is <i><b>r</b>ni Jwan</i> with <i>r-</i> at the beginning, while 'Juan talked' is <i><b>b</b>ni Jwan</i> with a <i>b-</i>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="You might also notice that in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the subject comes after the verb rather than before!"></a>  Each form has the same verb <a tabindex="0" class="jargon" data-toggle="popover" data-content="This is the part that encodes the actual meaning of the verb, 'talk'. We would hypothesize that the speaker stores the verb root in their memory, and constructs each form of the verb by applying rules about how TAM works.">root</a>, <i>ni</i>, but with a different prefix. You can never use <i>ni</i> on it’s own in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, it needs to have one of the TAM prefixes on it.

In other Zapotec languages, verbs are divided into groups based on which TAM prefixes they use. These groups are called verb <span class="jargon">classes</span>. We have something similar in English: some irregular verbs fall into patterns, like <i>sleep/slept</i>, <i>weep/wept</i>, <i>keep/kept</i>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="You can also have classes of other parts of speech. For example, Spanish has two noun classes, commonly called masculine (<i>el cielo</i> 'the sky') and feminine (<i>la biblioteca</i> 'the library')."></a> Based on related languages, I expect Tlacochahuaya Zapotec verbs to be divided into at least four (and possibly up to nine!) classes.  Identifying these classes is mostly a matter of learning lots of verbs and looking for patterns in their conjugation. I haven’t been able to clearly describe all of the classes yet, but I have noticed a few patterns.  As an example, I’ll just talk about three possible classes I’ve identified.  This is a super preliminary and somewhat simplified analysis, so please don’t quote me on it!

For this example, I’m just looking at two of the TAM prefixes, which for now I’ll call "past" and "future".<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="It is more complicated than this!"></a>  In the Class 1 verbs, the past form has the prefix <i>b-</i> and the future form has the prefix <i>i-</i>. Easy! These prefixes are used for the verbs 'ripen' and 'grow up'.

<table class="center">
    <caption>Verb Class 1</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th>verb</th> <th>"past"</th> <th>"future"</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td><i>ga̰ts</i> 'ripen'</td> <td><i><b>b</b>ga̰ts</i></td> <td><i><b>i</b>ga̰ts</i></td> </tr>
        <tr> <td><i>ni'is</i> 'grow up'</td> <td><i><b>b</b>ni'is</i></td> <td><i><b>i</b>ni'is</i></td> </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

In Class 2, the future still has the prefix <i>i-</i>, but the past form is different. Instead of adding a prefix <i>b-</i> like we did in Class 1, in these verbs we change the <i>k</i> in the verb root to a <i>kw</i>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="So far, all the verbs in this group begin with <i>k</i>."></a>  This class includes the verbs 'shiver' and 'borrow'.


<table class="center">
    <caption>Verb Class 2</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th>verb</th> <th>"past"</th> <th>"future"</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td><i>kanield</i> 'shiver'</td> <td><i><b>kw</b>anield</i></td> <td><i><b>i</b>kanield</i></td> </tr>
        <tr> <td><i>kala'</i> 'borrow'</td> <td><i><b>kw</b>ala'</i></td> <td><i><b>i</b>kala'</i></td> </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Finally, in Class 3, the past form has the prefix <i>b-</i>, but also the <i>g</i> in the verb root becomes a <i>d</i>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="So far, all the verbs in this group begin with <i>g<i>."></a>   On top of that, in the future tense, there's no <i>i-</i>! Instead, the <i>g</i> of the verb root becomes a <i>k</i>. (Also, the future form has a higher tone than the past form.) In this class, we have the verbs 'sew' and 'plant'.

<table class="center">
    <caption>Verb Class 3</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th>verb</th> <th>"past"</th> <th>"future"</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td><i>gib</i> 'sew'</td> <td><i><b>bd</b>ib</i></td> <td><i><b>k</b>ib</i></td> </tr>
        <tr> <td><i>gix</i> 'plant (a field)'<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="This verb is used specifically when you're planting something that grows as a field, rather than in rows. For example, they use this verb to describe planting alfalfa and parsley."></a></td> <td><i><b>bd</b>ix</i></td> <td><i><b>k</b>ix</i></td> </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

I've seen some other patterns in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec verbs, but it would be too much to discuss here. Zapotec verb classes can be <i>very</i> complicated, but that makes them very exciting to study!
