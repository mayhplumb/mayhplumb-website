<i>This is the twelfth in a series of blog posts by participants in the 2019 ACLS Digital Extension Grant project “Ticha: advancing community-engaged digital scholarship” (PI Lillehaugen) published on GlobalSL / Community-based Global Learning Collaborative and <a target="_blank" href="https://ticha.haverford.edu/en/updates/">Ticha</a>.</i>

The Ticha team started 2020 with a few goals: expand the resources available on the Ticha website, write a set of pedagogical materials, and workshop those pedagogical materials with Zapotec community members. Knowing little of what was to come, we started making big plans.

In a meeting last December, the team took some time to reflect on what we had actually accomplished in 2020. Many of our original plans did not work out in the way we had envisioned! But after lots of brainstorming and hard work, we had indeed met our goals. Everyone expressed a lot of gratitude towards the group, and something that stood out to me was how the deeply collaborative nature of the project had contributed to our successes throughout the year. As Xóchitl Flores-Marcial pointed out, “academia is generally pretty individualistic, it’s also very solitary, and this group demonstrates that we can definitely do things differently!”
