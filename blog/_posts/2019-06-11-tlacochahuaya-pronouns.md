One of the first things you learn when studying a language are the <span class="jargon">pronouns</span> — the <i>it</i>'s and <i>they</i>'s and <i>we</i>'s of a language. We use pronouns like variables, so that we can refer to different people and objects without using their full names.  <i>Some</i> of the pronouns of English are shown below. For the purpose of this table, I chosen the pronouns that I use most frequently/naturally.

<table class="center">
    <caption>(Some of the) English pronouns</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th></th> <th>singular</th> <th>plural</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td>1st person</td>                        <td class="foreign">I</td>        <td class="foreign">we</td>                 </tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person</td>                        <td class="foreign">you</td>    <td class="foreign">you/y'all</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, feminine</td>                <td class="foreign">she</td>    <td class="foreign">they</td>                 </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, masculine</td>                <td class="foreign">he</td>        <td class="foreign">they</td>                 </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, neutral/agender</td>        <td class="foreign">they</td>    <td class="foreign">they</td>                </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, inanimate/nonhuman</td>    <td class="foreign">it</td>        <td class="foreign">it</td>                 </tr>

There are many other pronouns in English: some dialects of English have <i>youse</i> as a 2nd person plural, for example, and there are additional agender pronouns, like <i>zie</i>.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="For information about agender pronouns and nonbinary folks generally, see these pages from: <a target=_'blank' href='https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/'>the UWM LGBT Resource center</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive'>the National Center for Transgender Equality</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.them.us/story/inqueery-agender'>the online publication <i>them</i></a>."></a>  Furthermore, some of the pronouns in this list have other uses, such as the so-called "royal <i>we</i>", which is singular, not plural. While I've called <i>it</i> the "3rd person, inanimate/nonhuman" form, we commonly give gendered animate pronouns to inanimate objects, like when we call boats<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Or if you're Jonathan Van Ness, anything!"></a> <i>she</i>.

The pronoun system I've given for English is just one way of dividing up individuals into groups. But different languages have different sets of pronouns! Many languages have a distinction between formal and informal 2nd person pronouns, like Spanish <i>Usted</i> vs. <i>tú</i>.  So how does this play out in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec? Here's the pronouns of the language as I currently understand them:<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content="This is <b>very preliminary research</b>, and I've simplified the spelling significantly, so please don't quote me on this!"></a>

Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has quite a few more pronouns than English does! In particular, they make many more distinctions in the third person. One pattern you might notice here is that all the third person plural pronouns include &lt;de&gt;. In fact, <i>de</i> on it's own is just a plural marker! So for example, <i>geht<i> means 'tortilla' and <i>de geht</i> means 'tortillas'.

For comparison, let's look at pronouns from San Lucas Quiaviní, another Zapotec-speaking town, just a few kilometers away from Tlacochahuaya.  You'll notice they look pretty different, even though the languages are so closely related!

        <tr> <td>2nd person, informal</td>                <td class="foreign">liu</td>    <td class="foreign">lad</td>         </tr>
        <tr> <td>2nd person, formal</td>                <td class="foreign">yu</td>        <td class="foreign">yuad</td>         </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, informal, nearby</td>        <td class="foreign">lang</td>    <td class="foreign">larëng</td>     </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, informal, far away</td>    <td class="foreign">lai</td>    <td class="foreign">lariny</td>     </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, respectful</td>            <td class="foreign">lazh:</td>    <td class="foreign">larazh:</td>     </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, reverent</td>                <td class="foreign">lainy</td>    <td class="foreign">lariny</td>     </tr>
        <tr> <td>3rd person, animal</td>                <td class="foreign">lamm</td>    <td class="foreign">larëmm</td>     </tr>

One key difference is that where Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has &lt;de&gt;, San Lucas Quiaviní has &lt;r&gt; or &lt;rë&gt;. Also, San Lucas Quiaviní has slightly different pronoun categories. For example, in this language, they distinguish between "nearby" and "far away" in the 3rd person informal. You might also notice that the San Lucas Quiaviní "respectful" pronoun, <i>lazh:</i>, looks a lot like the Tlacochahuaya "masculine" pronoun, <i>lazh:</i>.  The Tlacochahuaya version has been described to me as being only for men, but it could be it's used more generally in practice — that's something I'll need to find out! Also, just like we often use human pronouns for boats in English, it's likely that people can use Tlacochahuaya Zapotec pronouns outside of their "typical" categories.<a tabindex="0" class="footnote" data-toggle="popover" data-content='For example, in San Lucas Quiaviní, the "nearby" and "far away" categories may refer to either physical or psychological distance.'></a> That's something I'm on the lookout for when I'm translating Zapotec stories.

    <li>There are many linguists who specifically research pronouns and gender.
