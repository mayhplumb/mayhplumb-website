That’s what I’ll be writing my &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;A paper you write to prove you’re ready to write a doctoral dissertation. In my department, it’s about the same length and rigor as a Master’s thesis.&quot;&gt;Qualifying Paper&lt;/a&gt; about next fall, and it’s the primary focus of my &lt;a title=&quot;Posts about my 2019 fieldwork&quot; href=&quot;/blog/tag/fieldwork2019/&quot;&gt;fieldwork this summer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put “tense” in quotes because what we colloquially call “tense”, linguists break down into three smaller categories: &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;The chronology of events. When something happened relative to a certain point in time. Did it happen yesterday? Three years ago? Is it going to happen tomorrow?&quot;&gt;tense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Roughly, the state of the events progress — is it completed? in progress? ongoing? happening regularly? Some people call this the &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot; of the event.&quot;&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;How real the event is. Is it something that definitely happened? Or something that was supposed to happen but didn't? Something that might happen? Something that will definitely happen tomorrow?&quot;&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; (abbreviated together as TAM; click the words to get pop-up definitions).  These three categories are often very intertwined — it’s almost impossible to talk about one without the other two.  So what I’m actually researching right now is &lt;i&gt;TAM&lt;/i&gt; in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec.&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Most TAM markers in Zapotec languages are described as being primarily aspectual (having to do with aspect). But they also have implications about tense and mood.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, TAM can be marked with a suffix on the verb, as in &lt;i&gt;I dance&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;I dance&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;-d&lt;/i&gt; marks the past tense. We also use auxiliary verbs, like the &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; dance&lt;/i&gt;. In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, TAM is primarily indicated by a prefix on the verb, instead of a suffix.  For example, ‘Juan talks’ is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt;ni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; at the beginning, while ‘Juan talked’ is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;ni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; with a &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;You might also notice that in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the subject comes after the verb rather than before!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Each form has the same verb &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This is the part that encodes the actual meaning of the verb, 'talk'. We would hypothesize that the speaker stores the verb root in their memory, and constructs each form of the verb by applying rules about how TAM works.&quot;&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ni&lt;/i&gt;, but with a different prefix. You can never use &lt;i&gt;ni&lt;/i&gt; on it’s own in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, it needs to have one of the TAM prefixes on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other Zapotec languages, verbs are divided into groups based on which TAM prefixes they use. These groups are called verb &lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt;. We have something similar in English: some irregular verbs fall into patterns, like &lt;i&gt;sleep/slept&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;weep/wept&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;keep/kept&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;You can also have classes of other parts of speech. For example, Spanish has two noun classes, commonly called masculine (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;el cielo&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 'the sky') and feminine (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;la biblioteca&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 'the library').&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Based on related languages, I expect Tlacochahuaya Zapotec verbs to be divided into at least four (and possibly up to nine!) classes.  Identifying these classes is mostly a matter of learning lots of verbs and looking for patterns in their conjugation. I haven’t been able to clearly describe all of the classes yet, but I have noticed a few patterns.  As an example, I’ll just talk about three possible classes I’ve identified.  This is a super preliminary and somewhat simplified analysis, so please don’t quote me on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, I’m just looking at two of the TAM prefixes, which for now I’ll call “past” and “future”.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;It is more complicated than this!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  In the Class 1 verbs, the past form has the prefix &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt; and the future form has the prefix &lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;. Easy! These prefixes are used for the verbs ‘ripen’ and ‘grow up’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Verb Class 1&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;verb&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;past&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;future&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;ga̰ts&lt;/i&gt; 'ripen'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;ga̰ts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;ga̰ts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;ni'is&lt;/i&gt; 'grow up'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;ni'is&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;ni'is&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Class 2, the future still has the prefix &lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;, but the past form is different. Instead of adding a prefix &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt; like we did in Class 1, in these verbs we change the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; in the verb root to a &lt;i&gt;kw&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;So far, all the verbs in this group begin with &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;k&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  This class includes the verbs ‘shiver’ and ‘borrow’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Verb Class 2&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;verb&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;past&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;future&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;kanield&lt;/i&gt; 'shiver'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;kw&lt;/b&gt;anield&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;kanield&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;kala'&lt;/i&gt; 'borrow'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;kw&lt;/b&gt;ala'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;kala'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Class 3, the past form has the prefix &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt;, but also the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; in the verb root becomes a &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;So far, all the verbs in this group begin with &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;g&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   On top of that, in the future tense, there’s no &lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;! Instead, the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; of the verb root becomes a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;. (Also, the future form has a higher tone than the past form.) In this class, we have the verbs ‘sew’ and ‘plant’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Verb Class 3&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;verb&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;past&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;future&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;gib&lt;/i&gt; 'sew'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;bd&lt;/b&gt;ib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;ib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;gix&lt;/i&gt; 'plant (a field)'&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This verb is used specifically when you're planting something that grows as a field, rather than in rows. For example, they use this verb to describe planting alfalfa and parsley.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;bd&lt;/b&gt;ix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;ix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen some other patterns in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec verbs, but it would be too much to discuss here. Zapotec verb classes can be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; complicated, but that makes them very exciting thing to study!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Today I'm in Oaxaca City, Mexico.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Well, I drafted this in the Mexico City airport, but I'm revising it on the rooftop balcony of my hotel in Oaxaca City, where there's a lovely breeze, a view of the mountains, and a threat of rain.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tomorrow I head to San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya, about 20 km east of the city, where I'll spend the next month learning about Tlacochahuaya Zapotec. Since I'm here, I thought I'd answer the question posed to me by every rideshare driver: &quot;You're a linguist? But, um, what do you do?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When linguists study language, they're seeking to understand (a) what constraints there are on how languages work, and (b) how any particular language fits into those constraints.&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;First of all, that is not a completely comprehensive definition of linguistics, and second of all, neither of those questions is more important than the other!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Some linguists study how a speakers of a language produce and perceive sounds (&lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;phonetics&lt;/span&gt;), while others study how you order words in a sentence (&lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;syntax&lt;/span&gt;). Some linguists study how language shapes and interacts with identity (&lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;sociolinguistics&lt;/span&gt;), while others compare related languages to figure out what their ancestor language looked like thousands of years ago (&lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;historical linguistics&lt;/span&gt;).  And of course, you can study the linguistics of any language! Mandarin, English, Portuguese, Xhosa, or any of the other &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Linguistic Society of America page on linguistic diversity&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/how-many-languages-are-there-world&quot;&gt;nearly 7,000 thousand languages&lt;/a&gt; are available.  By looking at different languages from around the world, we can build a better understanding of how the human ability for language works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Map of the Tlacolula Valley. I spend most of my time in San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya, marked in blue in the middle of the map.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This map is from a book called &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oaxaca: Distritos, Limites, Caminos, Municipios, y Localidades&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, published by Angel García García y Asociados, S.C. It has maps of different parts of Oaxaca, as well as census data for all the towns. Last I tried, you could buy a copy at Priv. De Rayón No. 104, Centro, Oax. 68000. Or &amp;lt;a href='mailto:mayhplumb@utexas.edu'&amp;gt;email me&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; if you'd like a scan of something. :)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, my research has focused on a language called Valley Zapotec.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;More precisely I study Western Tlacolula Valley Zapotec, but that is a very long name, and that amount of detail isn't necessary here.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This language is spoken in the Tlacolula Valley, which stretches between Oaxaca City and Tlacolula de Matamoros. But while I call Valley Zapotec a “language”, in reality, every town in the Valley speaks a distinct variety.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Linguists call this region a 'dialect continuum' or a 'dialect chain'.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Informally, this is how 'healthy' the language is. While the primary factor in language vitality is the number of children who are learning the language, language vitality is also determined by things like how many contexts the language is used in (e.g. in the home, in school, in government), how much pressure there is from outside languages, and how the language is perceived.&quot;&gt;language vitality&lt;/a&gt; also varies from town to town. In San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya, where I have worked the most, children no longer speak the language, and the youngest fluent speaker is in his 40s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I’m in Tlacochahuaya, what will I actually be doing? In order to study Tlacochahuaya Zapotec grammar, I need to record examples of people using the language. This can be as simple as asking people to translate sentences, but it’s also important to collect examples of “natural” language. I frequently ask people to tell me stories in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, or to describe activities and customs (for example, I have recordings of people telling me about &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;How to plant garlic (AntonioGC)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262660&quot;&gt;how to plant garlic&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;All Saints Day celebrations (JoseAM)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262620&quot;&gt;All Saints’ Day celebrations&lt;/a&gt;). I then go through the recording sentence by sentence with one of my teachers to translate it into Spanish or English. By comparing data across many recordings, I can identify larger patterns in the language’s grammar that I would never be able to see in individual sentences.  This summer, I’m particularly interested in studying verb tenses — I’ll write about that some time!&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;It's... a bit more complicated than just 'tense'.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Disclaimer: this is what &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; do. Linguists do &lt;i&gt;all sorts of things&lt;/i&gt;, and even other linguists focusing on language documentation will have different priorities and methods than I do.  But in general, this is how linguistic fieldwork happens.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mayhplumb</name></author><category term="fieldwork2019" /><category term="fieldwork" /><category term="language-documentation" /><category term="zapotec" /><summary type="html">Today I'm in Oaxaca City, Mexico.

I’m using my inaugural post to mark a momentous occasion. It is with great pride that I announce &lt;i&gt;*drumroll*&lt;/i&gt; my very first archive deposit!

&lt;p&gt;Last summer (2018), I spent five weeks in San Jéronimo Tlacochahuaya (Oaxaca, Mexico) learning about the Zapotec language they speak there.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Tlacochahuaya Zapotec is also spoken in in diaspora communities in the United States.

So I put them in an &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Broadly speaking, an archive is a collection of objects that have been organized, cataloged, and otherwise prepared for long-term preservation. Archives are similar to museums, except that while museum curation focuses on the display of objects, archiving focuses on the permanent preservation of the objects.  If you want to learn more about archives, I recommend &amp;lt;a target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/QNN2LFe_iD8'&amp;gt;this video from the Tate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;, where anyone can access them. I chose the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;AILLA homepage&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org/&quot;&gt;Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America&lt;/a&gt; (AILLA), which is hosted at the University of Texas.  All of my recordings are publicly available. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Zapotec Collection of May Helena Plumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:257460&quot;&gt;You could go listen to them!&lt;/a&gt; (All you need to do is &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;AILLA registration page&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org/user/register&quot;&gt;create a free AILLA account&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue to add to my archive collection as my research progresses, but for now, there are 29 resources (63 total files).  Some of these resources are short texts in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, such as a session where Antonio García Cruz talked to me about &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;About donkeys (AntonioGC)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262614&quot;&gt;how smart donkeys are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Donkeys are very good at remembering routes and finding their way home, and they can navigate down craggy slopes very gently while carrying a heavy load.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Other resources focus on particular words and phrases, such as my conversations with Moisés García Guzmán about &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Funerals in SJT (MoisesGG)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla:262635&quot;&gt;ritual speech at Tlacochahuaya funerals&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, most of the resources contain audio recordings in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec and Spanish,&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Many of my conversations with Moisés are in English, though, so if you don't speak Spanish those are good resources to check out.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but in the future, I’ll add transcriptions and translations of the Zapotec audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This archive deposit has been a full year in the making,&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Yeah, it took a long time. I’ll write about why in a future post, probably.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s an exciting step in my research process. As I said above, putting my data in an archive means that other people can access it, which is an important part of responsible scholarship.  But why an archive and not just a personal website? Because AILLA will store my data longterm, making sure the recordings are safeguarded against &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Over time, things break down. Ink fades, cassette tapes desitegrate, and the bits that make up your audio files can get altered by small failures in the storage system.&quot;&gt;data decay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;As technology advanced, some file and storage formats become unreadable. Most people don't have an easy way to read a floppy disk, for example, and some old Microsoft Works documents can't be opened in a modern text editor.&quot;&gt;digital obscelence&lt;/a&gt;. This means that in the future, when Tlacochahuaya Zapotec changes (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Linguistics Society of America page on language change&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/english-changing&quot;&gt;as all languages do&lt;/a&gt;) or if it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Article on language endangerment from the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.21&quot;&gt;ceases to be spoken&lt;/a&gt;, we will still have a record of how it was spoken in 2018. Maintaining data is a lot of work, so to close, I’d like to thank the lovely folks at AILLA for their help setting up my collection. Give your archivist a (consensual) hug today!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m using my inaugural post to mark a momentous occasion. It is with great pride that I announce *drumroll* my very first archive deposit! I’ll go into more detail below, but if you want to skip ahead, you can check out my archive collection here. Last summer (2018), I spent five weeks in San Jéronimo Tlacochahuaya (Oaxaca, Mexico) learning about the Zapotec language they speak there.

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-6 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-2 center&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&quot;mx-auto d-block img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A blue bird drawn in a simple cartoon style.&quot; title=&quot;This is a wug.&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/what-is-a-wug/this-is-a-wug.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wug was invented by linguist Jean Berko Gleason&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;I took a selfie with her once. &amp;lt;img width='200px' src='/blog/img/what-is-a-wug/selfie-with-jean.jpg'/&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of a language acquisition experiment. Gleason wanted to find out when children learned to make English plurals.  So she drew small creatures with made-up names, like the wug, and set up a task where children were prompted to say plural forms of the words. The prompt looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col col-sm-9 col-md-6 col-lg-4 center&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&quot;mx-auto d-block img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A drawing of a bird is followed by the text 'This is a wug'. Two more birds are followed by the text 'Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two _'&quot; title=&quot;If you have a high-quality image of one of the other animals, let me know.&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/what-is-a-wug/this-is-a-wug-test.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English plural of &lt;i&gt;wug&lt;/i&gt; would be pronounced with a [z] sound on the end, [wʌgz].  If children produce this form, it means they’ve learned a general rule about creating English plurals, rather than simply memorizing the singular and plural of each noun. Gleason found that most preschoolers know how to make this plural (76%), and that almost all children aquire it by around age six (97% of first-graders).  She published these results in an 1958 article “The Child’s Learning of English Morphology”.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;The offical article is &amp;lt;a target='_blank' title='official page at Taylor &amp;amp; Francis' href='https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1958.11659661'&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  There's currently a free PDF &amp;lt;a target='_blank' title='PDF from Western University' href='https://anthropology.uwo.ca/faculty/creider/027/wugs.pdf'&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wugs are just so cute, they became the unoffical mascot of linguistics.  You’ll find them on mugs and t-shirts, and I embroidered one in the center of my animal-themed English vowel chart (for the &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; title=&quot;International Phonetic Alphabet&quot; data-content=&quot;The IPA is a standardized system where every speech sound is assigned a unique symbol. &amp;lt;a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet'&amp;gt;Wikipedia&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is a good starting place to learn more.&quot;&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt; vowel [ʌ]).&lt;/p&gt;
