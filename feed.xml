The next step of my PhD program is writing a dissertation proposal — so in a nut shell, I need to decide what questions I’m asking and what methods I’ll use to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, people usually talk about two data sources for language description: elicitation and texts. &lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;Elicitation&lt;/span&gt; includes asking for translations of words or sentences — “How do you say X in your language?”. Sometimes the researcher will construct a sentence and ask if it’s grammatical, and sometimes people elicit words and sentences using pictures rather than a verbal prompt, but elicitation always means you’re directly asking for a piece of linguistic information. When we say &lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;, on the other hand, we mean a more natural type of speech — for example someone telling a story, or explaining how to do a particular task. A text could be written or spoken; regardless, linguists then search the text for examples of a particular phenomenon and analyze it’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while we talk a lot about elicitation and texts, research in language documentation &amp;amp; description frequently bounces between many different methods, both quantitative and qualitative. One minute you’re observing/participating in a cultural event, another minute you’re testing a hypothesis in a structured elicitation session, another minute you’re conducting a semi-structured interview. In the evening, you’re journaling about your experiences and writing up qualitative memos while tagging data in a spreadsheet. There are many types of data, and many ways of analyzing that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trained in elicitation and text-collection, but I’m interested in expanding the research methods at my disposable. In order to understand my research process a little better, I’ve been watching videos on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-methods/&quot;&gt;Quantitative Methods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/&quot;&gt;Qualitative Methods&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Amsterdam (via Coursera). While many of the concepts introduced in these courses have been familiar to me, I haven’t always been taught them in a formal context; having words for different elements of my research process has helped me organize my thoughts a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the qualitative methods course Dr. Gerben Moerman used the phrase “epistemological&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;span class='jargon'&amp;gt;Epistemology&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; is, roughly speaking, the philosophy of how knowledge can be accessed and understood.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dialogue” to talk about the process of shifting between different research philosophies, and putting those philosophies is conversation to search out a more complete answer to your question. Moerman also used the phrase “iterative knowledge production”, discussing the constant dance between gathering data, reflecting on data, and drawing up theories. Both of those phrases speak to something I really appreciate about the language documentation process: the freedom to approach questions from a multitude of different perspectives. I want to take advantage of that freedom a little more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know exactly how I’ll be exercising methodological freedom in my dissertation — using more visual methods to get at speakers’ intuitions about temporal structure? conducting interviews to approach the concept of “time” from a more anthropological perspective? — but I’m excited to try.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mayhplumb</name></author><category term="research-methods" /><category term="mays-dissertation" /><summary type="html">Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about research methods.

This semester, I am officially&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;OK so technically, at the moment of this writing, I am not PhD Candidate in the eyes of the University of Texas at Austin Graduate School, because I have not yet applied for candidacy. But I'll probably do that like, next week or something. So I'm basically a PhD Candidate.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;i&gt;PhD Candidate&lt;/i&gt;. I have finished my graduate coursework. I have submitted a Qualifying Paper. I have convinced five kind scholars to be on my dissertation committee. I have reached the notorious ABD stage: All But Dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that this fall, I have “nothing” to do except plan and write a dissertation.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;I am very fortunate to have fellowship support, which allows me to focus on research without other commitments. While I'm a little sad that I won't get the opportunity to do much teaching, I'm grateful to have the flexibility that comes with fellowship time.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a wide-open semester, without the structure of regular coursework, is pretty daunting right now! This new stage of grad school comes with a lot of new challenges, not the least of which is organizing all this new-found time. This task is all the more difficult in 2020, when I’m working from home with even less structure (and less ability to plan for the future) than I might have had in the “before times”. I’ve experimented with a few different organizational strategies over the past 25 weeks of #PandemicLife, and I’ve started Fall 2020 with a new notebook and a new strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;New semester, new (bright pink) notebook, new 3-year plan* &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/j8cC7U9nkK&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/j8cC7U9nkK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; May Helena Plumb (@mayhplumb) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mayhplumb/status/1295419869270290432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of my notebook has three types of long-term plan: a 3-year plan (very tentative); a semester-long plan (goals for August–December 2020); and a month-long plan (goals for September 2020). Each Friday, I reference these lists while I make my schedule for the upcoming week. There are three features of my weekly schedule that I want to talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-9 center&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&quot;mx-auto d-block img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;My weekly schedule, freedrawn in a bullet journal, is divided into seven long horizonal strips. Each day has it's own color, and is divided into a list of events for the day, a small journal section, a list of work-related to-do's, and a list of additional household tasks.&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/transition-to-dissertation/weekly-to-do.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Planning each day's tasks a week in advance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I make my weekly schedule, I include my planned tasks for each day. In the past, when I’ve tried to plan my to-do’s in advance like this, the pile-up of short-term deadlines associated with coursework has gotten in the way. It can be hard to estimate how long a particular homework assignment will take, and once you go overtime on one task, the whole schedule can fall to pieces. But one of the benefits of my current research commitments is there’s a lot more flexibility about how quickly I get things done. And in my unstructured, work-from-home environment, having a concrete list of tasks helps me start each day with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;One reading goal and one writing goal most days of the week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next major milestone is my dissertation proposal, which I’m hoping to have finished around the end of October. It’s very scary to just starting writing though! I’ve recently discovered that reading can help jump start my writing process. If I read an article, and start jotting down my thoughts about how it impacts my research plans, I often find myself shifting pretty fluidly into freewriting (that is, writing a very rough, informal draft). And as an added benefit, I’m working through my massive pile of to-read articles! So while making my schedule each week, I choose the articles I want to read, and follow each one up with an open-ended “write” goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fridays are rest days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Fridays, I have just four to-do’s: practice my Spanish on the Fluent Forever app; backup my files; write a blog post (optionally); and make my schedule for the upcoming week. Friday afternoon happens to be the meeting time for the Documentation &amp;amp; Description research group at UT Austin, so it’s natural to have this day be set aside for administrative tasks and reflection. (It also gives me space to finish up any tasks that I might not have gotten to earlier in the week!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s how I’m trying to organize my transition to dissertation. But I’ve never done this before! So maybe my plans will change entirely, and that will be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;eldp.net/&quot;&gt;Endangered Language Documentation Programme&lt;/a&gt; (ELDP), one of the major funding agencies of linguistic fieldwork, announced on March 20 that they will not be reviewing applications submitted during the 2020 cycle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em;&quot;&gt;&quot;In light of the current COVID-19 crisis, and after many consultations and careful consideration, ELDP has decided to cancel the 2020 grant round. Given the global developments and required restrictions, ELDP will not be able to support any work that involves fieldwork or any other kind of travel and face to face interaction for the coming year.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the right decision on ELDP’s part. However, it’s anxiety provoking for graduate students who might have submitted an application to start fieldwork this coming fall, as delaying fieldwork could mean adding an extra year to their dissertation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before COVID-19, I planned to start my dissertation fieldwork on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayhplumb.com/blog/2019/06/18/intro-to-tlacochahuaya/&quot;&gt;Tlacochahuaya Zapotec&lt;/a&gt; with an eight-week trip to Oaxaca this coming fall. I was also planning a shorter trip to Oaxaca this June. Now, it’s unclear if research-related travel will be possible at all this year. Currently, borders are closed, and UT Austin has prohibited international travel on university business. Even if traveling to Oaxaca is possible this fall, I still need to evaluate whether it is safe and ethical to travel, as I will be working with older people and in communities which have limited access to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to have a number of different paths I can take without completely revamping my research. In particular, if my fieldwork opportunities are limited, I could shift my research to focus more on data from colonial resources, like the documents on the Ticha Project. I could also work with Zapotec speakers who live in the US, for example in Los Angeles. But both of these options still require a major shift in my methodology and potentially a new IRB (ethics board) application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dissertation research is not my most urgent concern, but it’s still constantly on my mind. It’s another layer of anxiety in this anxious world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mayhplumb</name></author><category term="covid-19" /><category term="personal" /><category term="fieldwork" /><category term="mays-dissertation" /><summary type="html">There are many things to write about COVID-19 and how it’s impacting graduate students right now.

My 2019 fieldwork is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork is complicated for me, as I imagine it is for many researchers. It is simultaneously the best part of my job and the most stressful. Research in the field is hard, and by the end I’m mentally exhausted. Traveling is hard for me, and usually after a month I’m emotionally exhausted. But overall, spending time in Oaxaca is one of the greatest blessings of my life (I wouldn’t do it if it didn’t make me happy). This post is a collection of things I love about Oaxaca, drafted slowly over the past five weeks.&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love saying &lt;i&gt;buenos días&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;buenas tardes&lt;/i&gt; to people in the street, even if I still feel a bit awkward and half the time I get the time of day wrong.  I love also how eventually I start becoming more attuned to the patterns of the church bells, so that I can tell when it’s past noon (and therefore &lt;i&gt;buenas tardes&lt;/i&gt; is the appropriate greeting). With each trip to Oaxaca, I start feeling a little more comfortable, a little more at home. Learning the patterns of the town is a big part of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After like a week I realized that the Tlacochahuaya church plays Ave Maria at noon, so that&amp;#39;s how people know at 12:02 that you&amp;#39;re supposed to say buenas tardes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;ve slowly become more accustomed to hearing the various bells that signal different things in town [2/3]&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; May Helena Plumb (@mayhplumb) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mayhplumb/status/1140718542758862848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love studying Zapotec. While I’m in Oaxaca, I get to spend all my hours thinking about language. There’s nothing else I’m supposed to be doing — not classwork or grading or renewing my drivers’ license, just delving into whatever aspect of Zapotec grammar excites me most. Not that it’s always easy. Some days I wrestle with the language. But other days I dance with it. Exploring the maze of language (and meeting people along the way) is constant source of joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love being close to nature. Most houses in Tlacochahuaya are organized as individual rooms that open onto a courtyard. It reminds me of my childhood, when I spent far more time outside and far less time in climate-controlled rooms. In Oaxaca, I get hear the rain, the wind, the thunder. I get to smell the dirt. I get to feel the chilled breeze of a coming storm. I sit in my bedroom doorway and watch the birds and the lizards. (I also scratch mosquito bites, which is significantly less pleasant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On the other hand, when I&amp;#39;m safely inside my room and the rain starts to pour, it is virtually impossible for me to work because I&amp;#39;m so distracted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanna watch the storm! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/jyHP1JzRAJ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/jyHP1JzRAJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; May Helena Plumb (@mayhplumb) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mayhplumb/status/1135698509011832832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the noise. Well, sometimes. If you ask me about it when I’m tired, when the roosters and the fireworks and the car alarms and the donkeys and the loudspeaker announcements all chime in together, with someone’s radio playing pop music a few doors down and the neighborhood dogs shouting their warnings to each other in the street… well, I might not have a very rosy attitude about the noise. But at the same time, I love it. Because noise is part of Oaxaca, and I love Oaxaca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at its core, that’s just how fieldwork is. It’s intense — sensorially, emotionally, academically. There is so much to take in, so much to do, so many new things vying for your attention in every moment. Fieldwork is &lt;i&gt;overwhelming&lt;/i&gt;, in every way, and that can be painful. But when I’m squashed into a collective taxi with six people and a turkey and a love song on the radio, and I’m watching the sun illuminate the distant mountains, I am mainly overwhelmed with happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close, let me offer some thanks. I am grateful to Brook Danielle Lillehaugen, who introduced me to Oaxaca and to Zapotec. I am grateful to other mentors who have supported my research over the years, including George Aaron Broadwell and Anthony C. Woodbury.  I thank the Tlacochahuaya 2016-2019 town council for their support of my project. And of course, my deepest gratitude goes to my Zapotec teachers, in particular Moisés García Guzmán, who housed me, fed me, and so graciously shared his language with me.&lt;/p&gt;

				Hello! Like many things I post on this blog, this research is in very early stages. This means that I may have simplified some more complicated details. It also means I might just be wrong! So please take this information as an early hypothesis, not a solid fact. If you'd like to find out my up-to-date opinions on the topic, feel free to email me.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the “tense” of a verb (which I’m actually going to call the “TAM”&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;It stands for 'tense, aspect, and mood'. You can check out the &amp;lt;a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense%E2%80%93aspect%E2%80%93mood'&amp;gt;Wikipedia page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to learn more, or see &amp;lt;a target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/VM8GlP6avF4'&amp;gt;this video&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for a discussion of the difference between tense and aspect&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is indicated by a prefix, for example ‘Juan talks’ is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt;ni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; at the beginning, while ‘Juan is talking’ is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;ka&lt;/b&gt;ni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; with the prefix &lt;i&gt;ka-&lt;/i&gt;. In a &lt;a title=&quot;Studying Tlacochahuaya Zapotec 'tense'&quot; href=&quot;/blog/2019/06/04/tlacochahuaya-zapotec-tam/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I looked at how verbs are divided into categories based on which TAM prefixes they use for “past” and “future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently in my research, I’ve been focusing on that &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; prefix in &lt;i&gt;rni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; ‘Juan talks’.  I want to figure out what the &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; means, which is a harder question that it might sound!&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; TAM (“tense”) in the world’s languages is often very complex in meaning. For example, the English “present tense” (&lt;i&gt;eats&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sits&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;hugs&lt;/i&gt;) usually indicates that an action is a habit/custom. That is, &lt;i&gt;Ellen eats meat&lt;/i&gt; means that Ellen is in the habit of eating meat (but she might not be eating meat right now). However, sports announcers also use the “present tense” form to talk about an event that is happening right this instant (&lt;i&gt;She shoots, she scores!&lt;/i&gt;). Furthermore, you can use the same “present tense” to make a story seem more immediate and exciting, even if the events you’re talking about happened in the past (&lt;i&gt;So I ask them to pass the salt, and they say…&lt;/i&gt;).  So in English, we use this “present tense” to mean many different things! Likewise, I want to know all the ways that you can use the Tlacochahuaya Zapotec &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When other researchers have described Zapotec languages, they usually call the &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; prefix “habitual” because it’s prototypical use is to indicate a habitual/customary action. Like the English present! However, unlike the English present, the Zapotec habitual can also be used to talk about &lt;i&gt;past&lt;/i&gt; habitual actions (like English &lt;i&gt;used to&lt;/i&gt;). Depending on context, &lt;i&gt;rni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; could just as easily mean ‘Juan talks [all the time]’ or ‘Juan used to talk [all the time, e.g. when he was a child]’. The Zapotec habitual &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; contrasts with the prefix &lt;i&gt;ka-&lt;/i&gt;, which indicates that an action is in progress (we call it “progressive”). Like with &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ka-&lt;/i&gt; can talk about the present or the past, so &lt;i&gt;kani Jwan&lt;/i&gt; can mean either ‘Juan is talking’ or ‘Juan was talking’.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;For those following along at home: 'Juan talks' in English is desribed as present tense, habitual aspect. 'Juan is talking' is described as present tense, progressive aspect.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, this seems pretty straight forward. Well, it is, until you ask someone how to say ‘the baby is sleeping’, and they say &lt;i&gt;ra’asy bdo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;interlinear&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;r-a'asy&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;bdo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;R-sleep&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This is called an &amp;lt;span class='jargon'&amp;gt;interlinear gloss&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;. The idea is to label each part of each word with it's meaning. But since I don't really know what &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;r-&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; means yet, I'm just labelling it 'R'!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;baby&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;'The baby is sleeping.'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that with the verb ‘sleep’, you usually don’t use the prefix &lt;i&gt;ka-&lt;/i&gt;. You just use &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; instead. There are a couple of other verbs like this, including ‘snore’ and ‘be hungry’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;interlinear&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;r-ubikia&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;bëny&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;R-snore&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;person&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;'The person is snoring.'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;interlinear&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;r-ndyeny&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;be'ekw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;R-be.hungry&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;dog&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;'The dog is hungry.'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a question I have right now is: which verbs exactly act like this? Is a fixed set of random verbs? Or is a category based on the type of action? I have a hypothesis I’m working with right now, but it’s too soon in the game to even post about it here!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mayhplumb</name></author><category term="fieldwork2019" /><category term="mays-qualifying-paper" /><category term="tense-aspect-mood" /><category term="zapotec" /><summary type="html">Disclaimer: This is preliminary research Hello!

Tlacochahuaya is about 18 kilometers east of Oaxaca City, a 40-minute drive from the city’s historical center, and has around 2,300 inhabitants.  Like most towns in the area, there are three parts of Tlacochahuaya’s name. &lt;i&gt;San Jerónimo&lt;/i&gt; (Saint Jerome) is the patron saint of the town. &lt;i&gt;Tlacochahuaya&lt;/i&gt; is the town’s Nahuatl name, and the official name used by the state.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Nahuatl is the language of the Aztecs, and the Spanish colonizers adopted these names for many towns throughout Mexico, regardless of the indigenous group that lived there. In Nahuatl, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tlacochahuaya&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; means 'wet place', referring to the lake that used to be here.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And of course, Tlacochahuaya also has a Zapotec name: &lt;i&gt;Zunni ro’o&lt;/i&gt;.  Incidentally, the word &lt;i&gt;Zapotec&lt;/i&gt; also comes from Nahuatl. In Tlacochahuaya, they call Zapotec people &lt;i&gt;Bënza&lt;/i&gt;, and the language is &lt;i&gt;Dizhsa&lt;/i&gt;.

        &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Map of the Tlacolula Valley; San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya is marked in blue in the middle of the map.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This map is from a book called &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oaxaca: Distritos, Limites, Caminos, Municipios, y Localidades&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, published by Angel García García y Asociados, S.C. It has maps of different parts of Oaxaca, as well as census data for all the towns. Last I tried, you could buy a copy at Priv. De Rayón No. 104, Centro, Oax. 68000. Or &amp;lt;a href='mailto:mayhplumb@utexas.edu'&amp;gt;email me&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; if you'd like a scan of something. :)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;i&gt;Zapotec&lt;/i&gt; does not refer to a single language, but to a language family containing dozens of individual languages.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;It’s similar in diversity to the Romance language family, which includes French, Spanish, Romanian, Italian, Catalan, Aragonese…&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Zapotec language family has a high level of dialect variation; in the Tlacolula Valley, every town speakers a slightly distinct variety of Zapotec. This forms what linguists call a “dialect chain”, where any two towns next to each other will be quite similar, but towns on opposite ends of the chain will speak very differently.  In this context, the difference between a “language” and a “dialect” is hard to define. Tlacochahuaya Zapotec is certainly its own variety within the Valley, but for example it has many similarities to the Zapotec spoken in San Lucas Quiaviní (near Tlacolula, which is marked in orange on the map above).&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;I’d also like to note that Oaxaca has a high level of linguistic diversity in general. Zapotec is one of many language families in the region, including Mixe, Otomi, Chatino, Mixtec, Zoque, and Chinantec. And each of these families contains several individual languages. There are hundreds of indigenous languages spoken in the state of Oaxaca!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tlacochahuaya Zapotec grammar is something I’ll expand upon in other posts (click &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/zapotec/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for all posts about Zapotec), but here are some basic facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Zapotec languages have Verb-Subject-Object word order. That means that while in English we say &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow, Juan will harvest corn&lt;/i&gt;, in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec you say &quot;Tomorrow, will harvest Juan corn&quot;.
        &lt;table class=&quot;interlinear&quot;&gt;
            &lt;tr class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;zhí&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;í-ndá’á&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Jwany&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;gell&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;tomorrow&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;future-harvest&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Juan&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;corn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr class=&quot;parts-of-speech&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;adverb&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;verb&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;subject&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;object&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;'Tomorrow, Juan will harvest corn'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Zapotec languages are tonal. This means that the pitch of a word can change what it means. So far, I've been able to identify four tones in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec: 
        1. low, as in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The entry for zhi'i on the Talking Dictionary&quot; href=&quot;http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/tlacochahuaya/?entry=3902&quot;&gt;zhi'i&lt;/a&gt; 'nose'; 
        2. high, as in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The entry for zhí'í on the Talking Dictionary&quot; href=&quot;http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/tlacochahuaya/?entry=3901&quot;&gt;zhí'í&lt;/a&gt; 'cold, flu'; 
        3. rising, as in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The entry for zhǐly on the Talking Dictionary&quot; href=&quot;http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/tlacochahuaya/?entry=3419&quot;&gt;zhǐly&lt;/a&gt; 'sheep'; 
        and 4. falling, as in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The entry for zhîly on the Talking Dictionary&quot; href=&quot;http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/tlacochahuaya/?entry=3857&quot;&gt;zhîly&lt;/a&gt; 'cotton'.
        (Click the words to hear recordings on the Talking Dictionary.)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;While English uses the passive construction to say things like &lt;i&gt;The money was counted&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The plate was cleaned&lt;/i&gt;, Zapotec tends to have stand-alone intranstive verbs for these (&lt;i&gt;-gab&lt;/i&gt; 'get counted, &lt;i&gt;-ye&lt;/i&gt; 'get cleaned').&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has six basic vowels: [i e a o u ɨ]. You can listen to these vowels using the phonetic alphabet guide &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ipachart.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;The sixth vowel [ɨ] is most difficult for English speakers to reproduce. To make it, you can start by make the vowel [i] as in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;beet&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. Then make the vowel [u] as in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;boot&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. Try going back and forth between these two vowels. Notice that in [i] the front of your tongue is raised up, and your lips are spread in a smile, while in [u] the back of your tongue is raised, and your lips are rounded. To make [ɨ], you should stop about half way between [i] and [u] (with the mid section of your tongue raised) and with your lips spread, not rounded.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, when it’s raining while the sun is shining (a sun shower), you say that a deer is being born, &lt;i&gt;kayal bzhëny&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tlacochahuaya, the youngest (fluent) speaker of Zapotec is in his early 40s. Because children are no longer learning the language — and because of the socioeconomic and cultural pressure of Spanish — linguists consider Tlacochahuaya Zapotec to be highly endangered. There are some towns in the Tlacolula Valley where Zapotec is still spoken by children, but this is very rare, partly because of discrimination against indigenous languages in schools. However, activists in Tlacochahuaya have started language workshops for both adults and children, which are generously supported by the local government.&lt;/p&gt;

To be clear, I love Oaxaca. It is a pleasure and a privilege to come here every year. But fieldwork is &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt;, and because the essence of my research is so tied up in my daily life, I need to be really conscious about taking breaks and de-stressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my self-care is in the little things that I pack. I always bring some nail polish, because it encourages me to take little moments for myself. &lt;!--excerpt--&gt; My packing list also includes a craft project — I just finished knitting a pair of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;My Ravelry project page for the socks&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ravelry.com/projects/mayhplumb/kalajoki&quot;&gt;socks&lt;/a&gt;, and my next project is a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;My Ravelry project page for the shawl&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ravelry.com/projects/mayhplumb/early-blooms&quot;&gt;shawl&lt;/a&gt; — and some comfort books.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This year's books are &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Adventures of Frog and Toad&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. I usually like to bring something nostalgic that's easy to read in bits and pieces.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  A new addition to my packing list this year is nice mints. A friend introduced me to these excellent rose-flavored ones, and they’ve been very helpful for calming myself down when I get stressed out about my research process.  These are all small things that are easy to pack but make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;These mints have been a lovely addition to my fieldwork self-care toolkit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They literally taste like a rose is blooming in your mouth.

&lt;p&gt;Another key I’ve discovered is maintaining communication with friends and family. I make a point to tell my boyfriend about my accomplishments each day, no matter how small, because telling someone else makes them feel real.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;He's a reliable and energetic cheerleader, even on my rough days, and I'm incredibly grateful for it.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I’m also part of a WhatsApp group with all of the other students in my department doing fieldwork. We talk about our wins and loses, ask questions about research methods, share pictures of lizards, and generally support each other through the summer.  Another way I stay in contact is by playing Words with Friends with my mom! Obviously, consistent communication isn’t feasible for all people and all field sites. But for me, at this stage of my research and of my life, it’s important to maintain those connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most important self-care strategies I’ve developed over the years are the ones that are specific to Oaxaca. While having reminders of home makes me feel comforted, it’s crucial to put some of my focus outward and to remember to take joy in my life here as well. One example: as a reward on a warm day, I get myself &lt;i&gt;nieve&lt;/i&gt; (somewhere between sorbet and Philly water ice) from one of the stands by the market.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;My favorite combination is &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;tuna&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (prickly pear fruit) with &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;leche quemada&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; ('burnt milk'), which I have never encountered in the US.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It’s a special Oaxacan treat, and it never fails to remind me how lucky I am to visit this lovely place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Since i) it&amp;#39;s warm out and ii) I succeeded at a thing today, I treated myself to un nieve de tuna con leche quemada&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(prickly pear fruit and &amp;quot;burnt milk&amp;quot; sorbet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bf82HIps8K&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/bf82HIps8K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; May Helena Plumb (@mayhplumb) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mayhplumb/status/1135960862706032641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these strategies are not right for everyone. Self-care in the field — like self-care anywhere! — is a slow and steady process of figuring out what works for you. But I do think that in planning for fieldwork, it’s worth considering these three categories of self-care: small comfort items from home; social connection with loved ones; and local activities to keep you grounded.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mayhplumb</name></author><category term="fieldwork2019" /><category term="personal" /><category term="self-care" /><summary type="html">This summer is my fifth research trip to Oaxaca, and over the years I’ve developed a few ways to remedy stress and homesickness.

But fieldwork is hard, and because the essence of my research is so tied up in my daily life, I need to be really conscious about taking breaks and de-stressing. Some of my self-care is in the little things that I pack.

				Hello! Like many things I post on this blog, this research is in very early stages. This means that I may have simplified some more complicated details. It also means I might just be wrong!

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you learn when studying a language are the &lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;pronouns&lt;/span&gt; — the &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;’s and &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt;’s and &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;’s of a language. We use pronouns like variables, so that we can refer to different people and objects without using their full names.  &lt;i&gt;Some&lt;/i&gt; of the pronouns of English are shown below. For the purpose of this table, I chosen the pronouns that I use most frequently/naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;(Some of the) English pronouns&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;singular&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;plural&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;1st person&lt;/td&gt;                        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;we&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;2nd person&lt;/td&gt;                        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;you&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;you/y'all&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, feminine&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;she&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;they&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, masculine&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;he&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;they&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, neutral/agender&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;they&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;they&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, inanimate/nonhuman&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;it&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;it&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other pronouns in English: some dialects of English have &lt;i&gt;youse&lt;/i&gt; as a 2nd person plural, for example, and there are additional agender pronouns, like &lt;i&gt;zie&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;For information about agender pronouns and nonbinary folks generally, see these pages from: &amp;lt;a target=_'blank' href='https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/'&amp;gt;the UWM LGBT Resource center&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a target='_blank' href='https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive'&amp;gt;the National Center for Transgender Equality&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a target='_blank' href='https://www.them.us/story/inqueery-agender'&amp;gt;the online publication &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;them&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Furthermore, some of the pronouns in this list have other uses, such as the so-called “royal &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;”, which is singular, not plural. While I’ve called &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; the “3rd person, inanimate/nonhuman” form, we commonly give gendered animate pronouns to inanimate objects, like when we call boats&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Or if you're Jonathan Van Ness, anything!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pronoun system I’ve given for English is just one way of dividing up individuals into groups. But different languages have different sets of pronouns! Many languages have a distinction between formal and informal 2nd person pronouns, like Spanish &lt;i&gt;Usted&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;tú&lt;/i&gt;.  So how does this play out in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec? Here’s the pronouns of the language as I currently understand them:&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This is &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;very preliminary research&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, and I've simplified the spelling significantly, so please don't quote me on this!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Tlacochahuaya Zapotec pronouns (spelling simplified)&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;singular&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;plural&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;1st person&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;nare&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;donn&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;2nd person, informal&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;liu&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;2nd person, formal&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;gibyu&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;yubtë&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, informal&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lány&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;ladeny&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, formal&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lab&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;ladep&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, reverent&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lany&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;ladény&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, masculine?&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lazh:&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;ladezh:&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, infant&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;laby&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;ladeby&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, animal&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lam&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;ladem&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, inanimate&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;niñ&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;deniñ&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has quite a few more pronouns than English does! In particular, they make many more distinctions in the third person. One pattern you might notice here is that all the third person plural pronouns include &amp;lt;de&amp;gt;. In fact, &lt;i&gt;de&lt;/i&gt; on it’s own is just a plural marker! So for example, &lt;i&gt;geht&lt;i&gt; means ‘tortilla’ and &lt;i&gt;de geht&lt;/i&gt; means ‘tortillas’.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, let’s look at pronouns from San Lucas Quiaviní, another Zapotec-speaking town, just a few kilometers away from Tlacochahuaya.  You’ll notice they look pretty different, even though the languages are so closely related!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec pronouns (based on Munro &amp;amp; Lopez's 1999 dictionary; spelling simplified)&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;singular&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;plural&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;1st person&lt;/td&gt;                        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;dannonn&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;2nd person, informal&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;liu&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lad&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;2nd person, formal&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;yu&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;yuad&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, informal, nearby&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;larëng&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, informal, far away&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lai&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lariny&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, respectful&lt;/td&gt;            &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lazh:&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;larazh:&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, reverent&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lainy&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lariny&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;3rd person, animal&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;lamm&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;foreign&quot;&gt;larëmm&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key difference is that where Tlacochahuaya Zapotec has &amp;lt;de&amp;gt;, San Lucas Quiaviní has &amp;lt;r&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;rë&amp;gt;. Also, San Lucas Quiaviní has slightly different pronoun categories. For example, in this language, they distinguish between “nearby” and “far away” in the 3rd person informal. You might also notice that the San Lucas Quiaviní “respectful” pronoun, &lt;i&gt;lazh:&lt;/i&gt;, looks a lot like the Tlacochahuaya “masculine” pronoun, &lt;i&gt;lazh:&lt;/i&gt;.  The Tlacochahuaya version has been described to me as being only for men, but it could be it’s used more generally in practice — that’s something I’ll need to find out! Also, just like we often use human pronouns for boats in English, it’s likely that people can use Tlacochahuaya Zapotec pronouns outside of their “typical” categories.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;For example, in San Lucas Quiaviní, the &amp;quot;nearby&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;far away&amp;quot; categories may refer to either physical or psychological distance.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That’s something I’m on the lookout for when I’m translating Zapotec stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more? You might have noticed that lots of people are talking about pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For introductions, the linguistics podcast &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://lingthusiasm.com/post/156181768226/transcript-lingthusiasm-episode-2-pronouns&quot;&gt;Lingthusiasm&lt;/a&gt; and the YouTube channel &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvohHpylRkY&quot;&gt;Ling Space&lt;/a&gt; both have episodes about pronouns.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are many linguists who specifically research pronouns and gender. As just two examples, I highly recommend work by Kirby Conrod (see &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Kirby's website&quot; href=&quot;https://kconrod.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Kirby's medium post about gender and linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kconrod/lsa-2019-trans-itive-gendering-fb9c3a7bc2d1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and Lauren Ackerman (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Lauren's page about pronouns and gender research&quot; href=&quot;https://lmackerman.com/pronouns-and-gender/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;

No matter how tired I am, no matter how much I want to put it off, it’s an essential part of my daily routine. The first thing I do is back up my recordings.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;I keep lots of copies of my recordings, in case one copy gets lost or damaged. (1) I keep the original SD cards. (2) I back up the SD cards to an external drive. (3) I move key files to a separate external drive, where they're organized by topic. (4) I slowly (pending wifi) move those key files to Dropbox. This might be excessive, but better safe than sorry.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And while my files are transferring, I go over my notes and make sure that all of my &lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt; is in order. Metadata is all the information about how the recording was made — who was there, where we were, what we talked about, what audio recorder I used, etc. Metadata is &lt;i&gt;data about data&lt;/i&gt;, and it’s a crucial aspect of good data management.&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper metadata serves many roles. For me as a researcher, it means I can always identify which handwritten notes go with which recordings, and I can remember which person told me what when. But more importantly, when I archive my data, metadata makes the resources more accessible to other researchers. Ideally, when some future linguist looks at my recordings, they’ll be able to reconstruct the research context and methodology. This means they can properly interpret what the data means and how it should be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my practice, I record metadata in three ways. First, at the start of each session, I record relevant information in my field notebook. My metadata for my first research session this summer looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-10 center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;mx-auto d-block img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;One page one of a notebook, there's the following text: 'May HP (Researcher), Moises GG (Speaker), June 1, 2019, SJTZ, San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya, Archive + CC = YES, Zoom H5 w/ XYH5 mic + Shure headset, SD005, Multi, Folder01, Zoom01, 190601-200918. Below the metdata you can see the first notes, the word 'dig' in a box, with the Zapotec 'gal rga'an' and the note '(infinitive/nomlz)'.&quot; title=&quot;I feel very vulnerable showing this to other people. Even though I know I'll archive it eventually, it feels so personal!&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/metadata/notebook-metadata.jpg&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;May Helena Plumb, NB005, page 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of information here! First I’ve noted the two people involved in this research session, me (MayHP), and Moisés García Guzmán; at the end of the notebook, I include a list of name abbreviations and brief biographical sketches.  I also note the date, and the language being documented. In this case, the language is San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, which I abbreviate “SJTZ” (again, there’s a list of language abbreviations at the back of the book).  I also include the town we were working, and I note whether Moisés gave permission for me to archive this material publicly.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;CC stands for &amp;lt;a target='_blank' title='The Creative Commons website' href='https://creativecommons.org/'&amp;gt;Creative Commons&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and I've specified the CC &amp;lt;a target='_blank' title='License page for CC BY-SA' href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/'&amp;gt;Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;... at the back of the notebook.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  I recorded this session, so I also note information about the recording, including the audio recorder and microphones I used,&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;A Zoom H5 Handy Recorder with the XYH-5 onboard mic, and a Shure SM10A-CN, which is a headset with a cardioid mic.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the SD card where the file was recorded.  There’s more information about the recording equipment — you guessed it — at the back of the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number string at the end of the metadata above, “190601-200918”, is the timestamp of the recording. I use that, in conjunction with the name of the speaker, as a way to uniquely name each audio file. When I transfer the files to my computer and organize them, I name them all with a common system to make them easy to search and identify. Each file is named with a language code, the time stamp, the name of the speaker, and a short description of the file contents.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;In the examples below, Tr1 marks the recordings from the headset mic, while TrLR marks the recordings from the recorder's onboard mic.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-10 center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;mx-auto d-block img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of files named with the schema defined above, for example 'SJTZ_190602-181041_MoisesGG_verb_paradigms_tam_Tr1.wav'&quot; title=&quot;If you can think of a better filenaming system... please just keep it to yourself? I have renamed my files enough already, thanks very much.&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/metadata/filenames.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Recordings in my &quot;SJTZ Verbs&quot; folder. I discuss some of this data in my post about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019/06/04/tlacochahuaya-zapotec-tam/&quot;&gt;Tlacochahuaya Zapotec &quot;tense&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also keep a spreadsheet that catalogs all my files, and the metadata that is required to archive them. I archive my data at the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The AILLA website&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ailla.utexas.org&quot;&gt;Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America&lt;/a&gt; (AILLA), and they have a specific set of metadata fields you’re required to fill out, such as the length of the audio file and the role (e.g. researcher, speaker, or translator) of each person involved. My files in AILLA are also organized folders (called “Resources”) for different grammatical or cultural topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;mx-auto d-block img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;The spreadsheet headings include 'Entered by', 'File name, 'Media Type', 'Resource Name', and 'Media language 1'. The media type for each file is 'sound_recording', and the resource name is 'SJTZ Verbs'. The first media language is 'Zapotec, Western Tlacolula Valley'.&quot; title=&quot;If you can think of a better filenaming system... please just keep it to yourself? I have renamed my files enough already, thanks very much.&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/metadata/metadata-spreadsheet.png&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A small section of my very large metadata spreadsheet. You can read more about my archive collection &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019/05/28/first-archive-deposit/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot of information to record at the end of each day, but it’s worth it to do it now! Last year I didn’t fully settle on a file-naming schema/organizational strategy until after I finished my fieldwork, and it caused a huge delay in archiving my data. Now that I have more practice, it all goes much more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more? Metadata is a very big topic, and people have lots of different ideas of what good metadata practice looks like. Here are a few starting points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America made a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;AILLA's filenaming video on YouTube&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Mcp5ozgx0&quot;&gt;short video about how to name files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;David Nathan and Peter K. Austin have written very good work about language documentation practices, and I recommend their article &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The article in volume 2 of Language Documentation and Description&quot; href=&quot;http://www.elpublishing.org/PID/029&quot;&gt;&quot;Reconceiving metadata: language documentation through thick and thin&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				Hello! Like many things I post on this blog, this research is in very early stages. This means that I may have simplified some more complicated details. It also means I might just be wrong! So please take this information as an early hypothesis, not a solid fact. If you'd like to find out my up-to-date opinions on the topic, feel free to email me.

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current focus of my research is “tense” in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec. That’s what I’ll be writing my &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;A paper you write to prove you’re ready to write a doctoral dissertation. In my department, it’s about the same length and rigor as a Master’s thesis.&quot;&gt;Qualifying Paper&lt;/a&gt; about next fall, and it’s the primary focus of my &lt;a title=&quot;Posts about my 2019 fieldwork&quot; href=&quot;/blog/tag/fieldwork2019/&quot;&gt;fieldwork this summer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put “tense” in quotes because what we colloquially call “tense”, linguists break down into three smaller categories: &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;The chronology of events. When something happened relative to a certain point in time. Did it happen yesterday? Three years ago? Is it going to happen tomorrow?&quot;&gt;tense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Roughly, the state of the events progress — is it completed? in progress? ongoing? happening regularly? Some people call this the &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot; of the event.&quot;&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;How real the event is. Is it something that definitely happened? Or something that was supposed to happen but didn't? Something that might happen? Something that will definitely happen tomorrow?&quot;&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; (abbreviated together as TAM; click the words to get pop-up definitions).  These three categories are often very intertwined — it’s almost impossible to talk about one without the other two.  So what I’m actually researching right now is &lt;i&gt;TAM&lt;/i&gt; in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec.&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;Most TAM markers in Zapotec languages are described as being primarily aspectual (having to do with aspect). But they also have implications about tense and mood.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, TAM can be marked with a suffix on the verb, as in &lt;i&gt;I dance&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;I dance&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;-d&lt;/i&gt; marks the past tense. We also use auxiliary verbs, like the &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; dance&lt;/i&gt;. In Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, TAM is primarily indicated by a prefix on the verb, instead of a suffix.  For example, ‘Juan talks’ is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt;ni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;r-&lt;/i&gt; at the beginning, while ‘Juan talked’ is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;ni Jwan&lt;/i&gt; with a &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;You might also notice that in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, the subject comes after the verb rather than before!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Each form has the same verb &lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;jargon&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This is the part that encodes the actual meaning of the verb, 'talk'. We would hypothesize that the speaker stores the verb root in their memory, and constructs each form of the verb by applying rules about how TAM works.&quot;&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ni&lt;/i&gt;, but with a different prefix. You can never use &lt;i&gt;ni&lt;/i&gt; on it’s own in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec, it needs to have one of the TAM prefixes on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other Zapotec languages, verbs are divided into groups based on which TAM prefixes they use. These groups are called verb &lt;span class=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt;. We have something similar in English: some irregular verbs fall into patterns, like &lt;i&gt;sleep/slept&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;weep/wept&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;keep/kept&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;You can also have classes of other parts of speech. For example, Spanish has two noun classes, commonly called masculine (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;el cielo&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 'the sky') and feminine (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;la biblioteca&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 'the library').&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Based on related languages, I expect Tlacochahuaya Zapotec verbs to be divided into at least four (and possibly up to nine!) classes.  Identifying these classes is mostly a matter of learning lots of verbs and looking for patterns in their conjugation. I haven’t been able to clearly describe all of the classes yet, but I have noticed a few patterns.  As an example, I’ll just talk about three possible classes I’ve identified.  This is a super preliminary and somewhat simplified analysis, so please don’t quote me on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, I’m just looking at two of the TAM prefixes, which for now I’ll call “past” and “future”.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;It is more complicated than this!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  In the Class 1 verbs, the past form has the prefix &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt; and the future form has the prefix &lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;. Easy! These prefixes are used for the verbs ‘ripen’ and ‘grow up’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Verb Class 1&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;verb&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;past&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;future&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;ga̰ts&lt;/i&gt; 'ripen'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;ga̰ts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;ga̰ts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;ni'is&lt;/i&gt; 'grow up'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;ni'is&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;ni'is&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Class 2, the future still has the prefix &lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;, but the past form is different. Instead of adding a prefix &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt; like we did in Class 1, in these verbs we change the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; in the verb root to a &lt;i&gt;kw&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;So far, all the verbs in this group begin with &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;k&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  This class includes the verbs ‘shiver’ and ‘borrow’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Verb Class 2&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;verb&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;past&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;future&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;kanield&lt;/i&gt; 'shiver'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;kw&lt;/b&gt;anield&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;kanield&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;kala'&lt;/i&gt; 'borrow'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;kw&lt;/b&gt;ala'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;kala'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Class 3, the past form has the prefix &lt;i&gt;b-&lt;/i&gt;, but also the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; in the verb root becomes a &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;So far, all the verbs in this group begin with &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;g&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   On top of that, in the future tense, there’s no &lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;! Instead, the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; of the verb root becomes a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;. (Also, the future form has a higher tone than the past form.) In this class, we have the verbs ‘sew’ and ‘plant’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Verb Class 3&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;verb&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;past&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&quot;future&quot;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;gib&lt;/i&gt; 'sew'&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;bd&lt;/b&gt;ib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;ib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;gix&lt;/i&gt; 'plant (a field)'&lt;a tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-content=&quot;This verb is used specifically when you're planting something that grows as a field, rather than in rows. For example, they use this verb to describe planting alfalfa and parsley.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;bd&lt;/b&gt;ix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;ix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen some other patterns in Tlacochahuaya Zapotec verbs, but it would be too much to discuss here. Zapotec verb classes can be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; complicated, but that makes them very exciting to study!&lt;/p&gt;
